            "I don\u00edt think I disagree. I think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation. you see the evidence of that in how dignity is being stripped from Labor. We have people that work full-time jobs and still can\u00edt make a living wage. We see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs, and you see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy that\u00eds hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete.",
            "One of the most aggressive bills in the Senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector. I feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work. I\u00edll tell you this. I live in a low income black and brown community. I see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans. The indicators that are being used from GDP to Wall Street\u00eds rankings is not helping people in my community. It is about time that we have economy that works for everybody, not just the wealthiest in our nation.",
            "Well again, I will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that. When it comes to antitrust law, what I will do is number one, appoint judges that will enforce it. Number two, have a DOJ and a Federal Trade Commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration. At the end of the day, we have too much of a problem with corporate power growing. We see that with everything from Citizens United and the way they\u00edre trying to influence Washington. It\u00eds about time that we have a President that fights for the people in this country.",
            "We need to have someone that\u00eds a champion for them.",
            "I absolutely will. First of all, we\u00edre talking about this as a healthcare issue, but in communities like mine, low income communities [inaudible 00:24:11] an education issue, because kids who don\u00edt have health care are not going to succeed in school. It is an issue for jobs and employment because people that do not have good healthcare do not succeed at work. It\u00eds even a retirement issue, because in my community, African Americans have a lower life expectancy because of poor health care and so where I stand is very clear, healthcare is not just a human right, it should be an American right.",
            "I believe the best way to get there is Medicare for All, but I have an urgency about this. When I am President of the United States, I\u00edm not going to wait. We have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care. On this debate, I\u00edm sorry, there are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in America from pharmaceutical companies to insurers. Literally the overhead for insurers that they charge is 15% while Medicare\u00eds overhead is only at 2%. We can do this better and every single day I will be fighting to give people more access and more affordable costs until we get to my goal-",
            "\u00d6 which is every American having healthcare.",
            "They should absolutely be held criminally liable because they are liable and responsible. This is one of The reasons why well before I was running for President, I said I would not take contributions from pharma companies, not take contributions from corporate PACs or pharma executives because they are part of this problem and this opioid addiction in our country. We, in cities like mine, have tried to arrest our way out of addiction for too long. It is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical companies that are responsible help to pay for that.",
            "Yes. [inaudible 00:02:43].",
            "On day one I will make sure that number one we end the ICE policies and the customs and border policies that are violating the human rights. When people come to this country, they do not leave their human rights at the border. Number two, I will make sure that we reinstate DACA, that we reinstate pathways to citizenship for DACA recipients, and to make sure that people that are here on temporary protected status can stay and remain here. And then finally, we need to make sure that we address the issues that made Oscar and Valeria come in the first place by making major investments in the northern triangle, not like this president is doing by ripping away the resources we need to actually solve this problem. We cannot surrender our values and then think that we\u00edre going to get border security. We actually will lose security and our values. We must fight for both.",
            "Jose.",
            "As my friend here said, I agree with him on that issue. But folks should understand that the separation of children from families doesn\u00edt just go on at our border. It happens in our communities as ICE are ripping away parents from their American children, spouses in the light, and are creating fear in cities all across this country where parents are afraid to even drop their kids off to school or go to work. We must end those policies.",
            "Well, this is a related and brief point. Because what we\u00edre talking about, what Secretary Castro and I are talking about, is that we have the power to better deal with this problem through the civil process than the criminal process. I have been to some of the largest private prisons which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration and their immigration lockups.",
            "Our country has made so many mistakes by criminalizing things, whether it\u00eds immigration, whether it\u00eds mental illness, whether it\u00eds addiction. We know that this is not the way to deal with problems. There is a humane way that affirms human rights and human dignity and actually solve this problem. Donald Trump isn\u00edt solving this problem. We\u00edve seen under his leadership a surge at our border. We solve this problem by making investments in the northern triangle to stop the reasons why people are being driven here in the first place, and we make sure we use our resources to provide health care, to affirm the values and human dignity the people that come here. Because we cannot sacrifice our values, our ideals as a nation for border security. We can have both by doing this the right way.",
            "May I address that? First and foremost, it was a mistake to pull out of that deal. And one of the reasons why we\u00edre seeing this hostility now is because Donald Trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation. Literally, he took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout 10, 20 years. And now we see Iran threatening to go further and who are pulled\u00d6 being pulled in further and further into this crisis.",
            "We need to renegotiate and get back into a deal, but I\u00edm not going to have a primary platform to say unilaterally I\u00edm going to rejoin that deal. Because when I am president of the United States, I\u00edm going to do the best I can to secure this country and that region and make sure that if I have an opportunity to leverage a better deal, I\u00edm going to do it.",
            "Well, first of all, I want to say my colleague and I both have been hearing this on the campaign trail. But what\u00eds even worse is I hear gunshots in my neighborhood. I think I\u00edm the only. I hope I\u00edm the only one on this panel here that had seven people shot in their neighborhood just last week. Someone I knew, Shahad Smith, was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year. For millions of Americans, this is not a policy issue, this is an urgency. And for those who have not been directly effected, they\u00edre tired of living in a country where their kids go to school to learn about reading, writing, and arithmetic, and how to deal with an active shooter in their school.",
            "This is something that I\u00edm tired of. And I\u00edm tired of hearing people\u00d6 All they have to offer is thoughts and prayers. In my faith, people say \u00ecFaith without works is dead.\u00ee So we will find a way. But the reason we have a problem right now is we\u00edve let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate. It is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda. I will get that done as president of the United States because this is not about policy. This is personal.",
            "I\u00edm going to use 20 of my seconds just to say this. One thing we don\u00edt all agree with when it comes to guns, and I think it\u00eds common sense and over 70% of Americans agree with me\u00d6 If you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to buy and own a firearm. And not everybody in this field agrees with that, but in states like Connecticut that did that, they saw 40% drops in gun violence and 15% drops in suicides. We need to start having bold agendas on guns.",
            "When it comes to the Supreme Court, very clearly we\u00d6 I agree with my friend, Secretary Castro, we are going to get to 50 votes in the senate. This is a team sport. Whoever is our nominee needs to campaign in places like South Carolina because we can elect Jaime Harrison. They need to campaign in places like Iowa because we can win a Senate seat there. This is about getting us back to having 50 votes in the Senate and more so that we can not only balance the Supreme Court, but start to pass an aggressive agenda that frankly isn\u00edt so aggressive because most of America agrees with the policy objectives of our party.",
            "You know, when I got to the United States Senate, going back to what De Blasio said, as an African American man in an African American dominated community, I knew one of the biggest issues was criminal justice reform. From police accountability to dealing with the fact that we have a nation that has more African Americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850. And when I got to the Senate, people told me we could not get a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill done. As my colleagues in the Senate know, I fought on that bill from the day I got to the Senate. Bill coalitions across the aisle and today we passed the First Step Act. It\u00eds not as far as I want to go, but thousands of people will be liberated. I\u00edve taken on tough problems people said we cannot achieve and I\u00edve been able to get things accomplished.",

            "This is not enough. Look. Civil rights is someplace to begin, but in the African American civil rights community, another place to focus on was to stop the lynching of African Americans. We do not talk enough about trans Americans, especially African American trans Americans and the incredibly high rates of murder right now. We don\u00edt talk enough about how many children, about 30% of LGBTQ kids who do no go to school because of fear. It\u00eds not enough just to be on the equality act. I\u00edm an original co-sponsor. We need to have a president that will fight to protect LGBTQ Americans every single day from violence in our country.",

            "Gracias. Fifty years ago, this month, my family moved into the town I grew up in, because after being denied a house because of the color of their skin, it was activists, mostly white activists that stood up and fought for them. That\u00eds the best of who we are as America, and why when I got out of law school, I moved into the inner city of Newark, to fight as a tenant lawyer for other people\u00eds rights. I\u00edve taken on bullies, and beat them. I\u00edve taken on tought fights, and we\u00edve won. And we win those fights not by showing the worst of who we are, but rising to who\u00eds best.",
            "Donald Trump wants us to fight him on his turf, and his terms. We will beat him. I will beat him by calling this country to a sense of common purpose again. This is a referendum on him and getting rid of him, but it\u00eds also a referendum on us, who we are, and who we must be to each other. It\u00eds time we win this election. And the way I\u00edll govern is by showing the best of who we are, because that\u00eds what this country needs and deserves."

            "Thank you very much for that question, Lester. I grew up with a mother who raised my brother Joaquin and me as a single parent, and I know what it\u00eds like to struggle. I know what it\u00eds like to rent a home and to worry about whether you\u00edre going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month, and to see a mom work very, very hard and know that moms across this country are getting paid less simply because they\u00edre women. I would do several things, starting with something we should\u00edve done a long time ago, which is to pass the Equal Rights Amendment finally in this country and also pursue legislation so that women are paid equal pay for equal work in this country. It\u00eds past time that we did that and we have to do this. If we want to be the most prosperous nation in the 21st century, we need to make sure that women are paid what they deserve.",
            "Yes, it would. I don\u00edt believe only in reproductive freedom, I believe in reproductive justice. What that means is just because a woman or lets also not forget someone in the trans community\u00f3a trans female, is poor doesn\u00edt mean they shouldn\u00edt have the right to exercise that right to choose. I absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion.",
            "More than that everybody in this crowd and watching at home knows that in our country today a persons right to choose is under assault in places like Missouri, in Alabama, in Georgia. I would appoint judges to the federal bench that understand the precedent of Roe v. Wade and would respect it and in addition to that, make sure that we fight hard as we transition our healthcare system to one where everybody can get and exercise that right.",
            "Thank you very much, Jose. I\u00edm very proud that in April I became the first candidate to put forward a comprehensive immigration plan. And we saw those images\u00d6",
            "Watching that image of Oscar and his daughter Valeria is heartbreaking. It should also piss us all off. If I were president today\u00d6 And it should spur us to action. If I were president today, I would sign an executive order that would get rid of Trump\u00eds zero tolerance policy, the Remain in Mexico policy, and the metering policy. This metering policy is basically what prompted Oscar and Valeria to make that risky swim across the river. They had been playing games with people who were coming and trying to seek asylum at our ports of entry. Oscar and Valeria went to a port of entry, and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim. So they got frustrated, and they tried to cross the river. And they died because of that.",
            "On day I would do that executive order that would address metering, and then I would follow that up in my first hundred days with immigration reform that would honor asylum claims that would put undocumented immigrants, as long as they haven\u00edt committed a serious crime, on a pathway to citizenship. And that would go to the root cause of the issue, which is we need a Marshall Plan for Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of coming to the United States to seek it.",
            "If I might very briefly\u00d6 And this is an important point. My plan\u00d6 And I\u00edm glad to see that Senator Booker, Senator Warren, and Governor Inslee agree with me on this. My plan also includes getting rid of Section 1325 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to go back to the way we used to treat this. When somebody comes across the border, not to criminalize desperation, to treat that as a civil violation. And here\u00eds why it\u00eds important. We see all of this horrendous family separation. They use that law, Section 1325, to justify under the law separating little children [crosstalk 00:04:24] from their families.",

            "Let\u00eds be very clear. The reason that they\u00edre separating these little children from their families is that they\u00edre using Section 1325 of that act, which criminalizes coming across the border, to incarcerate the parents and then separate them. Some of us on this stage have called to end that section, to terminate it. Some, like congressman O\u00edRourke, have not. And I want to challenge all of the candidates to do that.",

The answer to your question is no, we don\u00edt have to accept that.

You know, we may not have seen yet legislative action, but we\u00edre getting closer. The House took a vote. In the Senate, the question often is if the decision is between 60 votes, a filibuster, or passing common sense gun reform, I\u00edm going to choose common sense gun reform. So I believe that we\u00edre going to be able to get that done in 2021.",

In fact, you know, my first visit after I announced my candidacy wasn\u00edt to Iowa or New Hampshire, it was to San Juan, Puerto Rico because people should know that if I\u00edm elected president, everybody will count. And you know, I\u00edm one of the few candidates in this race with executive experience, with a track record of getting things done. When I was mayor of San Antonio, we moved our local public utility. We began to shift it from coal-fired plants to solar and other renewables and also created more than 800 jobs doing that. And when I was HUD Secretary, we worked on the National Disaster Resilience Competition to invest in communities that were trying to rebuild from natural disasters in a sustainable way. That\u00eds the way that we\u00edre going to help make sure that we\u00edre all safer in the years to come and that we combat climate change. And if I\u00edm elected president, the first thing that I would do, like Senator Klobuchar also said, is sign an executive order recommitting us to the Paris Climate Accord so that-",

Well, but what about Eric Garner and Tamir Rice and Laquan McDonald and Sandra Bland and Pamela Turner and Antonio [inaudible 00:35:03]. I\u00edm proud that I\u00edm the only candidate so far that has put forward legislation that would reform our policing system in America and make sure that no matter the color of your skin is, that you\u00edre treated the same, including Latinos who are mistreated too oftentimes by police.",

We know who Donald Trump is but in this election the question is who are we as a people? We have serious problems in America. We have deep wounds and seriously, deeply rooted challenges. We desperately need to heal as a nation and move forward. Because we know in this country that our fates are united, that we have a common destiny. The call of this election is the call to unite in common cause and common purpose. That\u00eds how we will beat Donald Trump. That\u00eds how I will beat Donald Trump and as your president, that\u00eds how I will govern and move us forward together.",
            "Well, first of all, let me just say that the person that\u00eds enjoying this debate most right now is Donald Trump, as we pit Democrats against each other while he is working right now to take away Americans\u00ed healthcare. There\u00eds a court case working through the system that\u00eds going to gut the Affordable Care Act and actually gut protections on pre-existing conditions. And so I was raised by two Civil Rights parents who told me to always keep your eyes on the prize and that is that the United States of America, every Democrat should stand with the belief that everyone should have access to healthcare. That it\u00eds a human right. And how we get there, it has to be to end this broken system, because we are on our way in just a handful of years, of literally spending 20% of our economy, one out of every $5 spent on healthcare.",
            "And we spend more than every other nation, on everything from MRIs to insulin drugs, multiple more than other countries. And so you want to know what I\u00edm going to do? I\u00edm going to work to get us to a point where Medicare for all, where everyone is covered. But this pitting against progressives against moderates, saying one is unrealistic and the other doesn\u00edt care enough, that to me is dividing our party and demoralizing us in the face of the real enemy here.",
            "[crosstalk 00:24:31] And I\u00edm going to keep fighting for that.",
            "Well first of all, I just want to say again tonight we are playing into Republican hands, who have a very different view and they\u00edre trying to divide us against each other. I\u00edm listening to the language of my colleagues. No, Mr. Vice President, we are not going to just let people cross the border.",
            "And unlawful crossing is an unlawful crossing if you do it in the civil courts, or if you do it through the criminal courts. But the criminal courts is what is giving Donald Trump the ability to truly violate the human rights of people coming to our country, who no one surrenders their human rights.",
            "And so doing it through the civil courts means that you won\u00edt need these awful detention facilities, that I\u00edve been to, seeing children sleeping on pavement, people being put in cages, nursing mothers, small children. This is not necessary. We have seen, using the civil system, piloted programs that have 100% compliance with the civil courts, where people are evaluated. If they have no justifiable reason to be here, they are returned.",
            "If they are, like the people I met in Juarez who were survivors of sexual assault, who we wouldn\u00edt even let come and present for asylum. We are butchering our values, and making ourselves less safe.",
            "Well, a couple things. First of all, Mr. Vice President, you can\u00edt have it both ways. You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can\u00edt do it when it\u00eds convenient and then dodge it when it\u00eds not.",
            "And the second thing, and this really irks me, because I heard the Vice President say that if you\u00edve got a PhD, you can come right into this country. Well that\u00eds playing into what the Republicans want, to pit some immigrants against other immigrants. Some are from shit hole countries, and some are from worthy countries.",
            "We need to reform this whole immigration system and begin to be the country that says everyone has worth and dignity, and this should be a country that honors for everyone. Don\u00edt let the Republicans divide this party against itself.",
            "Well, my response is that this is a crisis in our country because we have treated issues of race and poverty, mental health and addiction, with locking people up and not lifting them up. And Mr. Vice President has said that since the 1970s, every major crime bill, every crime bill, major and minor, has had his name on it. And so those are your words, not mine. And this is one of those instances where the house was set on fire, and you claimed responsibility for those laws. And you can\u00edt just now come out with a plan to put out that fire.",

            "Please show me that respect, sir. We have a system right now that\u00eds broken, and if you want to compare records, and frankly, I\u00edm shocked that you do, I am happy to do that because all the problems that he is talking about that he created, I actually led the bill that got passed into law that reverses the damage that your bills that you are frankly to correct you, Mr. Vice President, you are bragging, calling it the Biden crime bill up until 2015.",
            "Mr. Vice President, there\u00eds a saying in my community: you\u00edre dipping into the Kool-Aid, and you don\u00edt even know the flavor.",
            "You need to come to the city of Newark and see the reforms that we put in place. The New Jersey head of the ACLU has said that I embraced reforms, not just in action, but in deed. Sir, you are trying to shift the view from what you created.",
            "There are people right now in prison for life, for drug offenses because you stood up and used that tough on crime, phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroy communities like mine. This isn\u00edt about the past, sir. This is about the present right now.",

I\u00edll try harder. Look, the reason why is because first of all, this problem didn\u00edt start yesterday. Science didn\u00edt become a reality yesterday. This has been going on for years. There was another president that would not join an international accord. Then it was the Kyoto accord. I was mayor then and I stood up in national leadership, joining with other mayors to say climate change is not a separate issue.",

We have to go to far advance and makes sure that everything from our trade deals, everything from the billions of dollars we spend to foreign aid, everything must be sublimated to the challenge and the crisis that is existential, which is dealing with the climate threat. And yes, the majority of this problem is outside the United States, but the only way we\u00edre going to deal with this-",

Jake, look, this is one of those times where we\u00edre not staring at the truth and calling it out, and this is a case for the Democratic Party, the truth will set us free. We lost the State of Michigan, because everybody from Republicans to Russians were targeting the suppression of African American voters. We need to say that. If the African American vote in this state had been like it was four years earlier, we would have won the State of Michigan. We need to have a campaign that is ready for what\u00eds coming, an all-out assault, especially on the most valuable voter group in our, in fact, the highest-performing voter group in our coalition, which is black women. And so I will be a person that tries to fight against voter suppression, that can activate and engage the kind of voters and coalitions that are going to win states like Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.",
            "Well, first of all, I want to say very clearly that I will not do foreign policy by tweet as Donald Trump seems to do all the time. A guy that literally tweets out that we\u00edre pulling our troops out before his generals even know about it, is creating a dangerous situation for our troops in places like Afghanistan. And so I will bring our troops home and I will bring them home as quickly as possible. But I will not set, during a campaign, an artificial deadline. I will make sure we do it, we do it expeditiously. We do it safely to not create a vacuum that\u00eds ultimately going to destabilize the Middle East and, perhaps, create the environment for terrorism and for extremism to threaten our nation.",
            "My response is exactly that. I\u00edve read the report, I\u00edve read the redacted versions of the report. We have something that is astonishing going on the United States of America. We have a president that is not acting like the leader of the free world. He\u00eds acting like an authoritarian against the actual Constitution that he swore an oath to uphold. And so this is a difference with a lot of us on this debate stage. I believe that we, in the United States Congress, should start impeachment proceedings immediately. And I\u00edll tell you this, Debbie Stabenow has joined my call for starting impeachment proceedings. Because he is now stonewalling congress, not allowing or subjecting himself to the checks and balances. We swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. The politics of this be damned. When we look back in history at what happened when a President of the United States started acting more like an authoritarian leader than the leader of the free world, the question is what will we have done? And I believe the congress should do its job.",
            "Thank you. First, I just want to give a lot of thanks to the city of Detroit. They\u00edre hosting us today. And one of the reasons I respect this city is because it has the kind of defiant love that I find in many American cities, including the city of Newark. And Detroit is turning around. And Newark is turning around because we let no one divide us, no one demean or degrade us, or underestimate our worth. We pulled together and fought for common purpose and common cause.",
            "That\u00eds the history of this city. My mom is sitting there who was born in the city of Detroit, born to a guy that was a UAW worker. My grandfather who pulled his family out of poverty in the Depression. My grandmother joined him. She was really entrepreneurial, opened a pool hall and a laundry mat right here in this city. That is the American dream. And so many of us have stories like that. But the dream of this country is under threat right now.",
            "Well, my mom\u00eds generation, 80, 95% of baby boomers did better than their parents. It\u00eds now just a coin toss for millennials. We have a real crises in our country. And the crises is Donald Trump, but not only Donald Trump. I have a frustration that sometimes people are saying the only thing they want is to beat Donald Trump. Well, that is the floor, and not the ceiling.",
            "The way we beat Donald Trump is not just focusing on him. He wants to take all the oxygen out of the room. It\u00eds when we start focusing on each other, and understanding that our common bonds, and our common purpose to address our common pain is what has saved us before. It\u00eds what\u00eds gonna save us now. That is the kind of leader that I am going to be as President of the United States. Not just uniting the Democratic Party, but making sure that we put more indivisible back into this one nation under God.

It\u00eds about you and your family. I want you to know that if I\u00edm elected president, that I will work hard every single day so that you and your family can have good healthcare when you need it. So that your children and grandchildren can get a good education so that they can reach their dreams, and then you can have good job opportunities. Whether you live here in a big city like Detroit or in a small town in our country. I know we have a wonderful, special nation but that too many people are struggling and I know what that\u00eds like too. I grew up with a single mom in a poor neighborhood. But like many of you, I don\u00edt want to make America anything again. I don\u00edt want us to go backwards. We\u00edre not going back to the past. We\u00edre not going back where we came from. We\u00edre going to move forward. We\u00edre going to make America better than it\u00eds ever been in the years to come. Let\u00eds do that together.",

That whole time, she had Medicare. I want to strengthen Medicare for the people who are on it, and then expand it to anybody who wants it. I also believe though that if somebody has a private health insurance plan that is strong, that they want to hold onto, that they should be able to do that. What I don\u00edt believe is that the profit motive of big pharma or big insurance companies should ever determine in our great nation, whether somebody gets healthcare or not.",

Open borders is a right wing talking point, and frankly I\u00edm disappointed that some folks, including some folks on this stage have taken the bait. The only way that we\u00edre going to guarantee that we don\u00edt have family separations in this country again is to repeal section 1325 of the Immigration Nationality Act. That is the law that this President, this administration is using to incarcerate migrant parents and then physically separate them from their children.",

That we do a 21st century Marshall Plan with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala so that we can get to the root of this challenge, so people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to come the United States. That\u00eds how we can be smarter, more effective, and more humane when it comes to immigration policy.",
            "Yeah, uh, first of all Mr. Vice President, it looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past and one of us hasn\u00edt. Let me begin by telling you-",
            "Let me just start out by answering that question. My immigration plan would also fix the broken legal immigration system, because we do have a problem with that. Secondly, the only way that we\u00edre going to guarantee that these kinds of family separations don\u00edt happen in the future is that we need to repeal this law. There\u00eds still going to be consequences if somebody crosses the border. It\u00eds a civil action.",

But let me say, when we talk about criminal justice reform, there are a lot of things that we can talk about: sentencing reform, cash bail reform, investing in public defenders, diversion programs. I\u00edm proud that I\u00edm the only candidate that has put forward a police reform plan because we have a police system that is broken and we need to fix it and whether it\u00eds the case of someone like Tamir Rice or Michael Brown or Eric Garner, where the Trump Justice Department just decided not to pursue charges. We do ensure we have a national use of force standard and that we end qualified immunity for police officers so that we can hold them accountable for using excessive force.",
            "Well that it\u00eds much more than that because what we see, and this was a good example, the other day of the Department of Justice not going after Officer Pantaleo that \u00d6 Officer Pantaleo used a chokehold that was prohibited by NYPD. He did that for seven seconds. 11 different times, Eric Garner said that he couldn\u00edt breathe. He knew what he was doing, that he was killing Eric Garner, and yet he has not been brought to justice. That police officer should be off the street.",

A lot of Americans don\u00edt know that this is still a major problem out there. I was back in Flint about six weeks ago, and I released a plan to invest $50 billion so that we remove lead as a major public health threat. We need to do it, we can do it, and I will do it.",

Or ask fast food workers that I joined a couple of weeks ago that are working for minimum wage and can\u00edt provide for their families or pay the rent. So the idea that America is doing just fine is wrong. Not only that, this president always likes to take credit like he did this. We\u00edve now had about 105 straight months of positive job growth, the longest streak in American history. Over 80 months of that was due to President Barack Obama. Thank you, Barack Obama. Thank you, Barack Obama. So I believe that we need to invest in what will ensure that Americans can prosper in the years to come. Making sure they have the knowledge and skills to compete in the 21st century economy. Ensuring that they can afford the rent where they live and that they have health care so that they don\u00edt have to worry about going homeless because they can\u00edt afford a medical procedure.",

There are 10 different instances that Robert Mueller has pointed out where this president either obstructed justice or attempted to obstruct justice. And I believe that they should go forward with impeachment proceedings. As to the question of what my Department of Justice would do, I agree with those who say that a president should not direct an attorney general specifically to prosecute or not prosecute. However, I believe that the evidence is plain and clear and that if it gets that far that you\u00edre likely to see a prosecution of Donald Trump.",

At the same time, senator, I think that too many folks in the senate and in the congress had been spooked by 1998. I believe that the times are different. And, in fact, I think that folks are making a mistake by not pursuing impeachment. The Mueller Report clearly details that he deserves it. And what\u00eds going to happen in the Fall of next year, of 2020, if they don\u00edt impeach him it\u00eds easy to say, \u00ecYou see? You see? The Democrats didn\u00edt go after me on impeachment.

            "I would not, because the approach that President Trump has taken has been extremely volatile without any clear strategic plan and it has a ravaging and devastating effect on our domestic manufacturers, on our farmers, who are already struggling and now failing to see the light of day because of the plan that Trump has taken.",
            "This is real in a way that\u00eds very difficult to convey in words. I was deployed to Iraq in 2005, during the height of the war, where I served in a field medical unit where every single day I saw the high cost of war. Just this past week, two more of our soldiers were killed in Afghanistan. My cousin is deployed to Afghanistan right now. Nearly 300 of our Hawaii National Guard soldiers are deployed to Afghanistan. 14,000 service members are deployed there. This is not about arbitrary deadlines. This is about leadership. The leadership I will bring to do the right thing, to bring our troops home within the first year in office. Because they shouldn\u00edt have been there this long. For too long we\u00edve had leaders who have been arbitrating foreign policy from ivory towers in Washington without any idea about the cost and the consequence, the toll that it takes on our service members, on their families. We have to do the right thing, end these wasteful regime-change wars, and bring our troops home.",
            "We were all lied to. This is the betrayal. This is the betrayal to the American people, to me, to my fellow service members. We were all lied to, told that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, was working with Al-Qaeda, and that this posed a threat to the American people. So I enlisted after 9/11 to protect our country. To go after those who attacked us on that fateful day, who took the lives of thousands of Americans. The problem is that this current president is continuing to betray us. We were supposed to be going after Al-Qaeda. But over years now not only have we not gone after Al-Qaeda, who is stronger today than they were in 9/11, our president is supporting Al-Qaeda.",
            "Thank you. Donald Trump and warmongering politicians in Washington have failed us. They continue to escalate tensions with other nuclear-armed countries like Russia, and China, and North Korea, starting a new Cold War, pushing us closer and closer to the brink of nuclear catastrophe. Now as we stand here tonight, there are thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at us. And if we were to get an attack right here tonight, you would have 30 minutes, 30 minutes before we were hit.",
            "And you would receive an alert like the one we received in Hawaii last year that would say incoming missile. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill. And you would see as we did, as my loved ones in Hawaii did, there is no shelter. This is the warmongers hoax. There is no shelter. It\u00eds all a lie. As president, I will end this insanity because it doesn\u00edt have to be this way.",
            "I will end these wasteful regime change wars. Work to end this new Cold War through the use of diplomacy to deescalate these tensions. And take the trillions of dollars that we\u00edve been wasting on these wars and on these weapons, and redirect those resources into serving the needs of our people right here at home. Things like healthcare for all, making sure everyone in this country has clean water to drink and clean air to breathe, investing in education, investing in our infrastructure. The needs are great. As your president, I will put your interests above all else."

She was one of my only three women in her law school class and worked with gay couples for basic rights. If you want to get something done just tell me it\u00eds impossible. As a freshman senator, I was told you couldn\u00edt repeal don\u00edt ask, don\u00edt tell. Even numbers of my own party told me it wasn\u00edt convenient. When are civil rights ever convenient? We stood up to the Pentagon and we got it done, not impossible. 10 years ago, I was told you couldn\u00edt pass healthcare for our 9/11 first responders. Those heroes who raced up the towers when others were coming down. Even when Congress turned its back on them, we kept fighting. Just last week we made the 9/11 health bill permanent. Beating Donald Trump, definitely not impossible. We need a nominee who will take on the big fights and win. We need a nominee who doesn\u00edt know the meaning of impossible.",

When I was a young mother and had Theo as an infant, he had an allergic reaction to eggs and his whole body turned red and puffy. I had to rush him to the emergency room. My heart is palpitating, because I\u00edm worried that his throat will close. I am not worried about not having an insurance card, or a credit card in my wallet. I know whatever they\u00edre going to prescribe, whether it\u00eds an EpiPen or an inhaler, I can afford it. The truth about healthcare in America today is people can\u00edt afford it. They cannot afford, and these insurance companies, for these plans that rely on insurance companies, I\u00edm sorry.",

Because the truth is, the Republicans and Trump, their whole goal is to take away your healthcare.",

            "So, I think when you talk about whether this should be a crime, you have to remember who we\u00edre talking about. When I was at the Texas border, I visited with women who had fled violence. A woman from El Salvador, owned a small business, gangs came to her and said, \u00ecIf you don\u00edt give us all your money, we\u00edre going to kill your family.\u00ee That\u00eds why she fled.",
            "Another woman was raped, that\u00eds why she fled. So this is who we\u00edre talking about, and they\u00edre not criminals. So I believe that we should have a civil violation. No president before President Trump enforced the law in the way he has enforced it, because he\u00eds using it as the crutch to lock up women and children, to separate mothers and babies, to put them behind bars. So I don\u00edt think we should have a law on the books that could be so misused. It should be a civil violation, and we should make sure that we treat people humanely.",
            "Again, President Trump, under his administration, seven children died in his custody. Under his administration families have been torn apart. This party is talking about real ideas for the future. We\u00edre talking about what we will do to change America. But we must not forget about our values.",
            "We used to believe in this country you should treat others the way you want to be treated. We used to believe in this country we should care about the least among us. Let\u00eds remind the American people who we are, why we are Democrats and why we\u00edre running for president ..",

If I was the mayor, I\u00edd fire him, but as President, I would make sure that we had a full investigation, that the report would be made public, and if I wasn\u00edt satisfied, we would have a consent decree.",

He promised no bad trade deals. Not only did he not have bad trade deals, he started a trade war with China, and he just signed onto another bad trade agreement with NAFTA 2.0, a giveaway to drug companies in Mexico. I took the bus to Michigan, to Ohio, and to Pennsylvania, telling people that he has broken his promises to them. I lifted up their voices, I listened to their concerns, and I offered real solutions.

But what he wrote an Op-ed was that he believed that women working outside the home would, \u00ecCreate the deterioration of family.\u00ee He also said that women who were working outside the home were, \u00ecAvoiding responsibility.\u00ee And I just need to understand, as a woman who\u00eds worked my entire career as the primary-wage earner, as the primary caregiver\u00d6 In fact, my second son Henry is here and I had him when I was a member of Congress. So, under Vice President Biden\u00eds analysis, am I serving in Congress resulting in the deterioration of the family because I had access to quality, affordable daycare? I just want to know what he meant when he said that.",

            "And that we are avoiding\u00d6 These are quotes. It was the title of the Op-ed.",

They actually have to put food on the table. Eight out of 10 moms are working today. Most women have to work to provide for their kids. Many women want to be working to provide for their communities and to help people.",

So this then becomes a moment that we must fight for the best of who we are and fight of course we will. And this is not a new fight for us as Americans.

Listening to experts, listening to healthcare providers and what I came away with is a very clear understanding that I needed to create a plan that was responsive to the needs of the American people. Responsive to their needs, understanding that insurance companies have been jacking up the prices for far too long. That American families have to be held down by deductibles and copays and premiums that can cause them bankruptcy.",
            "I listened to the American families who said four years is just not enough to transition into this new plan. So I devised a plan where it\u00eds going to be 10 years of a transition. I listened to American families who said, I want an option that will be under your Medicare system that allows a private plan. So I designed a plan where yes, responsive to the needs of American families, there will be a public plan under my plan for Medicare and a private plan under my plan for Medicare. Because the bottom line is this, we must agree that access to healthcare must be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. And in America today, far too many people, in fact, 30 million people are going without access to healthcare.",
            "Absolutely. Unfortunately, Vice President Biden, you\u00edre just simply inaccurate in what you\u00edre describing. The reality is that our plan will bring healthcare to all Americans under a Medicare For All system. Our plan will allow people to start signing up on the first day. Babies will be born into our plan and right now four million babies almost are born every day in America or every year in America. Under our plan, we will ensure that everyone has access to healthcare. Your plan by contrast, leaves out almost 10 million Americans. So I think that you should really think about what you\u00edre saying, but be reflective and understand that the people of America want access to healthcare and do not want costs to be their barrier to getting it.",

Over the next 10 years, it\u00eds probably going to be $6 trillion. We must act. My plan is about immediately allowing people to sign up and get into coverage.

In terms of the point that Senator Gillibrand is raising, I couldn\u00edt agree more.

Employers are not going to be able to dictate the kind of healthcare that their employees get. They will be able to make that decision. Private insurance companies and private carriers, if they comply by our rules and play by our rules, we\u00edll be able to offer those employees healthcare coverage under a private Medicare plan, or they can have the option of a public Medicare plan. But it is misleading to suggest that employees want what their employer is offering only, they want choice and my plan gives that to them.",

Jerome Powell just dropped the interest rates, and he admitted why, because of this so-called trade policy that this president has that has been nothing more than the Trump trade tax that has resulted in American families spending as much as $1.4 billion more a month on everything from shampoo to washing machines.

There are 10 clear incidents of obstruction of justice by this president and he needs to be held accountable. I\u00edve seen people go to prison for far less. And the reality of it is that we have a person in the White House right now who has been shielded by a memo in the United States Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be indicted. I believe the American people are right to say there should be consequence and accountability for everyone and no one is above the law, including the President of the United States,",

My plan is one of national mobilization, quickly bringing 100% clean energy to Americans, creating eight million good union jobs. This is a big, bold, ambitious plan for clean energy for a big, bold, ambitious nation. Middle ground approaches are not enough. We must confront the fossil fuel industry. I\u00edve been working on this for 25 years and now we know this, we\u00edre a tipping point. And whether we shrink from this challenge or rise to it is the vital question of our time.

I know this may sound like a gimmick but this is a deeply American idea. From Thomas Payne to Martin Luther King to today. Let me tell you why we need to do it and how we pay for it. Why do we need to do it? We already automated away millions of manufacturing jobs and chances are your job could be next. If you don\u00edt believe me, just ask an auto worker here in Detroit. How do we pay for it? Raise your hand in the crowd if you\u00edve seen stores closing where you live. It is not just you, Amazon is closing 30% of America\u00eds stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing it. We need to do the opposite of much of what we\u00edre doing right now. And the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math. So let me share the math. On $1,000 a month for every adult would be $461 million every month right here in Detroit alone. The automation of our jobs is a central challenge facing us today. It is why Donald Trump is our president and any politician not addressing it is failing the American people.",

As someone who\u00eds run a business, I can tell you flat out our current healthcare system makes it harder to hire. It makes it harder to treat people well and give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees. It makes it harder to switch jobs, as Senator Harris just said, and it\u00eds certainly a lot harder to start a business.

He said, \u00ecWe\u00edre doing it because we refused to postpone.\u00ee Well, I refuse to postpone one more minute spending billions of dollars on curing cancer, Alzheimer\u00eds, and other diseases, which if we invest in them, we can find cures. I refuse to postpone giving every single child in America, no matter their zip code, pre-K all the way through high school and beyond. I refuse to postpone any longer taking on climate change, and leading the world in taking on climate change. Look, this is the United States of America. There has never been a single, solitary time when we\u00edve set our mind to something that we\u00edve not been able to do it. We\u00edre walking around with our heads down, like, \u00ecWoe is me.\u00ee We\u00edre the best equipped nation in the world to take this on. It\u00eds no longer time to postpone. We should get moving. There\u00eds enormous, enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump.",

Well, I\u00edm for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way in which we add to it, replace everything that\u00eds been cut, add a public option. Guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance, number one.",
            "Number two, I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are. My plan for health care costs a lot of money. It costs $740 billion. It doesn\u00edt cost $30 trillion. $3.4 trillion a year, it turns out, is twice what the entire federal budget is. That\u00eds before it exists now, without interest on the debt. How are we going to pay for it? I want to hear tonight how that\u00eds happened.",
            "As far as my distinguished friend, the senator on my left, has not indicated how she pays for it. The senator has in fact come forward and said how he\u00eds going to pay for it, but it gets him about halfway there. There\u00eds a lot of other things that need to be done. I have a bold plan to deal with making sure we triple the money for at risk schools, that are title one schools, from $15 to $45 billion a year. I go down the line, and each of the things we\u00edre talking about, I lay out how I can pay for it, how I can get it done, and why it\u00eds better.",

You\u00edll be able to get into a\u00d6 Anyone who can\u00edt afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare type option we have, et cetera, but guess what? Of the 160 million people who liked their health care now, they can keep it. If they don\u00edt like it, they can leave. Number one.",
            "Number two. The fact of the matter is, we\u00edre in a situation where, if you noticed, he hadn\u00edt answered the question. This is about candor, honesty, big ideas. Let\u00eds have a big idea. The tax of 2% the senator\u00eds talking about? That raises about $3 billion. Guess what? That leaves you about $28 billion short. The senator said before, it\u00eds going to cost you in your pay. There will be a deductible in your paycheck. The middle class person, someone making 60 grand for three kids, they\u00edre going to end up paying $5,000 more. They\u00edre going to end up paying 4% more on their income tax.

When Dr. King was assassinated we were occupied by the National Guard for 10 months. I\u00edve been involved from the beginning. As a young councilman I introduced legislation to try to keep them putting a sewer plant in a poor neighborhood. I made sure that we dealt with redlining. Banks should have to lend where they operate, etc. The fact of the matter is that what\u00eds happened is that we\u00edre in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldn\u00edt be in jail. The whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change. We should be talking about rehabilitation. Nobody should be in jail for a non-violent crime. When we were in the White House we released 36000 people from the federal prison system. Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem.",
            "They should be going directly to a rehabilitation. We build more rehabilitation centers, not prisons. I\u00edm the guy that put in the drug courts to divert people from the criminal justice system. So we have to change the whole way we look at this, and we put people in prison, we have to equip them when they get out. Nobody who got in prison for marijuana for example immediately upon being released they shouldn\u00edt be in there for a misdemeanor. That should be a misdemeanor, they should be out and their record should be expunged. Every single right should be returned. When you finish your term in prison you should be able to not only vote, but have access to Pell Grants, have access to be able to get housing, have access to be able to move along the way. I\u00edve laid out a detailed plan along those lines, and the fact is we\u00edve learned so much more about-",

I\u00edm the guy that brought the Brady Bill into focus and became law. So that\u00eds number one. Number two, after Sandy Hook a number of things happened. It\u00eds went from a cause to a movement. Look what\u00eds happened now. Mothers, the organization, Mothers Against Gun Violence. We\u00edve seen what\u00eds happened again. Now we have all these young people marching on Washington, making sure that things are going to change. There has been a sea change. Those proposals I put forward for the president had over 50% of members of the NRA supporting them, and overwhelmingly the rest of the people supporting them. Now the numbers are much higher, because they realize what I\u00edve been saying, and we\u00edve all been saying, is correct. Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons \u00d6",

We didn\u00edt do all of those things, number one. Number two, this is the president who came along with the DACA program, no one had ever done that before, the president sent legislation to desk saying he wants to find a pathway for the 11 million undocumented in the United States of America.

I would change the order that the president just changed saying women who were being beaten and abused could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum.

            "The fact of the matter is, China, the problem isn\u00edt the trade deficit. The problem is they\u00edre stealing our intellectual property. The problem is they\u00edre violating the WTO. They\u00edre dumping steel on us. That\u00eds a different issue than whether or not they\u00edre dumping agricultural products on us.",
            "In addition to that, we\u00edre in a position where if we don\u00edt set the rules, we in fact are going to find ourselves with China setting the rules. And that\u00eds why you need to organize the world to take on China to stop the corrupt practices that are underway.",

I\u00edve been in and out of Afghanistan, not with a gun, and I admire my friend for his service, but I\u00edve been in and out of Afghanistan I think more than anybody on this \u00d6 And it\u00eds an open secret. You reported a long time ago, George, that I was opposed to the surge in Afghanistan. The whole purpose of going to Afghanistan was to not have a counter insurgency, meaning that we\u00edre going to put that country together. It can not be put together. Let me say it again, it will not be put together. It\u00eds three different countries. Pakistan owns the three counties \u00d6 the three provinces in the east. There are not any part of the [inaudible 00:20:37] run it. I will go on and on.",
            "But here\u00eds the point. The point is that it\u00eds a counter-terrorism strategy. We can prevent the United States from being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan by providing for bases, insist the Pakistanis provide bases for us to airlift from, and to move against what we know. We don\u00edt need those troops there. I would bring them home. And Joe Dunford\u00eds a fine guy, but this has been an internal argument we\u00edve had for eight years.",
            "With regard to Iraq, the fact of the matter is that I should\u00edve never voted to give Bush authority to go in and do what he said he was going to do. The AUMF was designed, he said, to go in and get the security council to vote 15 to nothing, to allow inspectors to go in to determine whether or not anything was being done with chemical weapons or nuclear weapons. And when that happened, he went ahead and went anyway without any of that proof.",
            "I said something that was not meant the way I said it. I said from that point on what I was argued against in the beginning, once he started to put the troops in, was that, in fact, we were doing it the wrong way. There was no plan. We should not be engaged. We didn\u00edt have the people with us. We didn\u00edt have our aligned \u00d6 We didn\u00edt have allies with us, etc. And it was later when we came into office, that Barack, the president, turned to me and said, \u00ecJoe \u00d6\u00ee when they said we got to plan to get out, he turned to the whole security, and said, \u00ecJoe will organize this. Get the troops home.\u00ee",

Make sure you have the record player on at night. Make sure the kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor background will hear four million words fewer spoken by the time they get there. There\u00eds so much we can-",
            "No, I\u00edm going to go like the rest of them do, twice over. Okay? Because here\u00eds the deal. The deal is that we\u00edve got this a little backwards.",

You\u00edre all acting like we just discovered this yesterday. Thank you very much.",

I lost my faith for awhile. I came back. Then later when my son Beau came home from Iraq and with a terminal disease and a year later, a year and a half later, losing him was like losing part of my soul.

She said, \u00ecBoy, if all you see in this neighborhood is problems, that\u00eds all there\u00eds ever going to be, but if you\u00edre stubborn, and defiant, and can put forth a vision that can unify people, then we can make transformative change.\u00ee She was a church woman that said, \u00ecWithout vision, the people will perish.\u00ee",

At our best, we unify. We find common cause and common purpose. The differences amongst us Democrats on the stage are not as great as the urgency for us to unite as a party. Not just to beat Donald Trump, but to unite America in common cause and common purpose. That\u00eds why I\u00edm running for president, and that\u00eds how I will lead this nation.",

Because we forget national shootings, these mass shootings or tragedies, but the majority of the homicide victims come from neighborhoods like mine.

The city council at the time was only paying $1,040 a year. So, everybody had another job, and my job was at the law firm. Well, a few months after I got elected, the law firm got a client. The client wanted those of us on the city council to vote for a land deal. The land deal was that they wanted to build a golf course over our water supply, because we relied on an underground aquifer. I didn\u00edt think the environmental protection plan was strong enough, so I wanted to vote against it and my constituents wanted me to vote against it. But under the ethics rules for lawyers in Texas, because believe it or not, lawyers have ethics rules, you can\u00edt just go against the interests of a client. So, I was stuck.",

I wondered before I went into it whether it would change who I was. I was proud that when that first test came that I stood up for the people that I was there to represent and not for big special interests. There\u00eds nobody that gets tested more in a position of public trust than the President of the United States. This President has failed that test, but I want you to know that if you elect me president, I won\u00edt. I won\u00edt serve anybody except you and your family.

First, I have a few words for Donald Trump, who we all know is watching. President Trump, you spent the last two and a half years full time trying to sow hate and division among us, and that is why we\u00edve gotten nothing done. You have used hate, intimidation, fear, and over 12,000 lies as a way to distract from your failed policies and your broken promises. The only reason you\u00edve not been indicted is because there was a memo in the Department of Justice that says the sitting president cannot be charged with a crime. Here\u00eds what you don\u00edt get. What you don\u00edt get is that the American people are so much better than this. We know that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, regardless of our race, where we live, or the party with which we\u00edre registered to vote.

Which is about offering people choice, not taking that from them. So under my Medicare for All plan people have the choice of a private plan or a public plan, because that\u00eds what people want, and I agree we shouldn\u00edt take choice from people. But here\u00eds the thing, everybody on this stage I do believe is well-intentioned and wants that all Americans have coverage and recognizes that right now 30 million Americans don\u00edt have coverage.

We all fought against it, and then the late great John McCain, at that moment at about 2:00 in the morning, killed his attempt to take healthcare from millions of people in this country. Fast-forward to today, and what is happening? Donald Trump\u00eds Department of Justice is trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Donald Trump\u00eds administration is trying to get rid of the ban that we placed on denying people who have preexisting conditions coverage. Donald Trump is trying to say that our kids up to the age of 26 can no longer be on our plans, and frankly I think this discussion have given the American public a headache. What they want to know is that they\u00edre going to have healthcare and cost will not be a barrier to getting it. But let\u00eds focus on the end goal.

I made a decision to become a prosecutor for two reasons, one, I\u00edve always wanted to protect people and keep them safe, and second, I was born knowing about how this criminal justice system in America has worked in a way that has been informed by racial bias, and I could tell you extensively about the experiences I and my family members have personally had. But I made a decision that if I was going to have the ability to reform the system, I would try to do it from the inside. So I took on the position that allowed me, without asking permission, to create one of the first in the nation initiatives that was a model and became a national model around people who are arrested for drugs and getting them jobs. I created one of the first in the nation requirements that a state law enforcement agency would have to wear cameras and keep them on full-time.",

I plan on shutting down for-profit prisons on day one. It will be about what we need to do to hold law enforcement, including prosecutors, accountable, and finally, my plan is about making sure that in America\u00eds criminal justice system we de-incarcerate woman and children, that we end solitary confinement, and that we work on keeping families intact.

That was their ticket to the middle class. Me, I got my big opportunity about a half a mile down the road from here, at the University of Houston, back when it cost $ 50 a semester. For a price that I could pay for on a part time waitressing job, I got to finish my four year degree, and I became a special needs teacher. After law school, my first big job was back here in Houston. By then, I had two little kids, and when childcare nearly brought me down, my Aunt [Bea 00:14:53] moved in and saved us all. The paths to America\u00eds middle class have gotten a lot smaller and a lot narrower. Today, service members are preyed upon by predatory lenders. Students are crushed by debt and families cannot afford childcare. I know what\u00eds broken. I know how to fix it, and I\u00edm going to lead the fight to get it done.",
            "Let\u00eds be clear about healthcare, and let\u00eds actually start where Vice President did. We all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally transformed healthcare in America, and committed this country to healthcare for every human being. Now the question is, how best can we improve on it? I believe the best way we can do that is we make sure that everybody gets covered by healthcare at the lowest possible cost. How do we pay for it? We pay for it. Those at the very top, the richest individuals, and the biggest corporations, are going to pay more, and middle class families are going to pay less. That\u00eds how this is going to work.",
            "Look, what families have to deal with is cost. Total cost. That\u00eds what they have to deal with. Understand. Families are paying for their health care today. Families pay every time an insurance company says, \u00ecSorry, you can\u00edt see that specialist.\u00ee Every time an insurance company says, \u00ecSorry, that doctor is out of network. Sorry.

What\u00eds going to happen in their budgets. The answer is, on Medicare for all, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals, and costs are going to go up for giant corporations, but for hardworking families across this country, costs are going to go down. That\u00eds how it should work under Medicare for all in our health care.",

I\u00edve met people who like their nurses. I\u00edve met people who like their pharmacists. I met people who like their physical therapists. What they want is access to health care, and we just need to be clear about what Medicare for all is all about. Instead of paying premiums into insurance companies, and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage, we\u00edre going to do this by saying everyone is covered by Medicare for all. Every healthcare provider is covered. The only question here, in terms of difference, is where to send the bill.",

People who have sick family members won\u00edt have to get into these battles. What this is about is making sure that we have the most efficient way possible to pay for health care for everyone in this country.

I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said, let\u00eds do background checks, let\u00eds get rid of assault weapons and with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster.

            "So, I remember lying on my floor, looking up, wondering how did it come to this, Eventually, I picked myself back up. I kept working in small growth companies for another ten years and eventually had some success. Then after I did have some success, I still remembered how hard it was, how isolating it was, how it feels like your friends no longer want to spend time with you. So, I spent seven years starting and running a nonprofit that helped train young entrepreneurs around the country, including Sean Wen, who\u00eds here in the audience tonight who left his gilded Wall Street job to become a food entrepreneur in San Antonio. Sean, I hope I made the process a little bit easier for you than it was for me. The goal of my campaign is to make this an economy that allows us to live our human values and aspirations."

I said from the beginning that if in fact Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller report. If they did that, they would have no choice, no choice, but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information. This president and I agree with Bernie, Senator Sanders, is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this President of United States has gone so far as to say since this latest event that in fact he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment.

My son\u00eds statement speaks for itself. What I think is important is we focus on why it\u00eds so important to remove this man from office. On the 17th \u00d6 look, the fact that George Washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president, that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections. It was the greatest threat to America.",
            "This president on three occasions, three occasions has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the President and his thugs have already proven that they in fact are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn\u00edt want me to be the candidate. He\u00eds going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.",

We\u00edve always kept everything separate. Even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed any, so there\u00edd be no potential conflict. My son made a judgment. I\u00edm proud of the judgment he made. I\u00edm proud of what he had to say and let\u00eds focus on this, the fact of the matter is that this is about Trump\u00eds corruption. That\u00eds what we should be focusing on.",
            "First of all, the plan we\u00edre hearing discussed is the Biden plan, the one I put forward, build on Obamacare, at public option. We can go into that, I can talk about that if you\u00edd like. But here\u00eds the deal, on the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it\u00eds awfully important to be straightforward with them. The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget and we talk about how we\u00edre going to pay for it. The study recently came out showing that in fact it will reduce costs, but for people making between $50 and $75,000 year, their taxes are going to go up about $5,000 because the fact is they\u00edll pay more in new taxes, 7.4% plus or 5% plus a 4% income tax. If a fireman and a schoolteacher are making 100,000 bucks a year, their taxes are going to go up about 10 grand. That is more than they will possibly say on this healthcare plan. We have a plan put forward that will work.",
            "No, look. Demonizing wealthy people. What I talked about is how you get things done. The way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. We have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would eliminate the capital gains tax that\u00d6 I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5%. I would double it, because guess what? Why in God\u00eds name should someone who\u00eds clipping coupons in the stock market make\u00d6 in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who, in fact, is\u00d6 like I said, a school teacher and a firefighter.

We can eliminate it all. I could go into detail, had I the time. Thirdly, what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We\u00edre going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not. This is one of the reasons why these debates kind of crazy. Because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody\u00eds right about the fact that the Fourth Industrial Revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed. If they\u00edre going back, they\u00edre not investing in their employees. They\u00edre reinvesting and buying back their stock.",

The way to deal with those guns and those AR-15s and assault weapons that people own is to do what we did with the National Firearms Act as it related to machine guns. You must register that weapon. You must register it. When you register it, the likelihood of it being used diminishes exponentially. I\u00edm the only one that moved to make sure that we could not have a magazine that had more than 10 rounds in it. I\u00edve done this. I know how to get it done.

So really what you\u00edre saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war that has caused so many refugees to flee Syria, that you would continue to have our country involved in a war that has undermined our national security, you would continue this policy of the U.S. actually providing arms and support to terrorist groups in Syria, like Al-Qaeda, HTS, Al-Nusra, and others because they are the ones who have been the ground force in this regime change war.

I am grateful to have been trained very well by the army and do my best to stay in shape, but here\u00eds the real question I believe you should be asking, is who is fit to serve as our commander-in-chief? This is the most important responsibility that the president has. What Donald Trump has been doing in Syria and what we have just seen with him inviting Turkey to come in and slaughter the Kurds, show what an unfit president looks like it.

It\u00eds unfortunate to see how, in this country, it has for so long been used as a divisive political weapon. I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare I think she\u00eds correct. We see how the consequences of laws that you\u00edre referring to can often lead to a dangerous place.

When I look out at our country, I don\u00edt see deplorables, I see fellow Americans. People who I treat with respect even when we disagree and when we disagree strongly. I will work to restore a White House that represents light and compassion and respect for every American regardless of race, religion, orientation, gender or political affiliation.

This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that and that is outrageous. And I think in terms of the recent Ukrainian incident, the idea that we have a President of the United States who is prepared to hold back national security money to one of our allies in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension. So I look forward, by the way, not only to a speedy and expeditious impeachment process, but Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.",

We all owe a debt that we cannot repay. We all drink deeply from wells of freedom and liberty that we did not dig. This is the moment in America where we need a leader that can inspire us to get up and fight again, that we have truly a moral moment in America like it was back in 1965.

I have the experience of being commanded into a war zone by an American president. I have the experience of knowing what is at stake as the decisions made in those big white buildings come into our lives, our homes, our families, our workplaces and our marriages.

Just as local leaders have shown great leadership, we need to use the powers of the presidency on challenges like this, expanding opportunity and expanding a sense of belonging to those who have been excluded in this country.

And what we saw today is Ambassador Sondland, by his own words told us that everyone was in the loop. That means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the President, from what we heard today, the Vice President, the Secretary of State and the Chief of Staff.

What we need on the stage on the November is someone who has the ability to win, and by that we need someone on that stage who has the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump, and someone who has the ability to rebuild the Obama coalition, and bring the party and the nation together, I believe I am that candidate.",

And to do it in a way that understands that part of the strength of who we are as a nation and therefore an extension of our ability to be secure is not only that we have a vibrant military, but that when we walk in any room around the globe, we are respected because we keep to our word, we are consistent, we speak truth, and we are loyal.",

Over 70% of the people support Roe V Wade, over 90% of the people support funding for Planned Parenthood and making sure that women can get the healthcare they need.\u00ee He is off the track on this and he will hear from the women of America.

I think this kind of experience matters. I have been devoted to this from the time that I\u00edve got to the Senate. I think having that experience, knowing how you can get things done, leading the bills to take the social media companies to task a bipartisan bill to say, \u00ecYeah, you have to say where these ads come from and how they\u00edre paid for,\u00ee and stop the unbelievable practice where we still have 11 states that don\u00edt have backup paper ballots. That is my bipartisan bill and I am so close to getting it done. The way I get it done is if I\u00edm president. Just like I have won statewide, and Mayor, I have all appreciation for your good work as a local official and you did not when you tried, I also have actually done this work. I think experience should matter.",

I have bold ideas that we can do to go forward as a country to make college more affordable and bring down the costs of healthcare, yes. This is also a patriotism check, a value check, a decency check. When you look at the people that turned out in Kentucky, and turned out in Virginia, people turned out that didn\u00edt vote in 2016.

But we cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump, because if we are, you know what? We\u00edre going to lose the election. Right now, you\u00edve got 87 million people who have no health insurance, or under-insured. We are facing the great existential crisis about time in terms of climate change. You got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street, and you got 18 million people paying half of their limited incomes for housing. What the American people understand is that the Congress can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time. In other words, we can deal with Trump\u00eds corruption, but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country. We also have to stand up to the fact that our political system is corrupt, dominated by a handful of billionaires, and that our economy is rigged with three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of America. We can do it all when we rally the American people in the cause of justice.",

And the American people understand today that the current healthcare system is not only cruel, it is dysfunctional. Now you tell me how we have a system in which we spend twice as much as do the people of any other country, and yet we got 87 million uninsured, underinsured, in some cases we pay 10 times more for prescription drugs as do the people of Canada, or other countries. 500, 000 people go bankrupt because of medically-related issues, they come down with cancer, and that\u00eds a reason to go bankrupt?",

But at the end of the day, what we need to do is to bring our people together, not just in opposition to Trump. The initial question I think that you wrote, that somebody raised him was that we are a divided nation. You know what? I kind of reject that. I think when you talk about the pain of working families in this country, majority of the American people want to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. When you talk about the climate crisis, the overwhelming majority of the American people know that it is real. They know we have to take on the fossil fuel industry.",

We have a president who is engaged in corruption. We have a president who was obstructed justice, and in my view, somebody was a violated the emoluments clause. I think Joe is right.

And I think we need a foreign policy which understands who our enemies are, that we don\u00edt have to spend more money on the military than the next 10 nations combined.

Senator Harris, rightly raised the question of economic justice. Let me give a specific example, and that is student loan debt. Right now African Americans are more likely to borrow money to go to college, borrow more money while they\u00edre in college and have a harder time paying that debt off after they get out. Today in America, a new study came out 20 years out. Whites borrowed money, 94% of them have paid off their student loan debt. 5% of African Americans had paid it off. I believe that means everyone on the stage should be embracing student loan debt forgiveness. It will help close the black-white wealth gap. Let\u00eds do something tangible and real to make change in this country.",
            "If there are parts of the wall that are not useful in our defense, of course, we should do it. The real point here is that we need to stop this man-made crisis at the border. Trump is the one who has created this crisis and he has done it in no small part by helping destabilize the governments even further in Central America. He has withdrawn aid, that means that families have to flee for their lives, have to flee for any economic opportunity. You know what? I found out that our government was actually taking away children from their families.",

There was like a giant Amazon warehouse filled with cages of women, cages of men and cages of little girls and little boys. I spoke to a woman who was in the cage of nursing mothers and she told me she\u00edd given a drink to a police officer, and that the word had come down from the gangs that she was helping the police. She knew what that meant. She wrapped up her baby and she ran for the border. We need to treat the people who come here with dignity and with respect. A great nation does not separate children from their families. We need to live our values at the border every single day.",

We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix it and the majority of Americans are with us on it and yet we don\u00edt make change. Why not? Because of corruption, because we have a government that works better for big drug companies than it does for people trying to fill a prescription.

Whether it\u00eds infrastructure, childcare, housing, health. On issue after issue, we\u00edve got to break out of the Washington mindset that measures the bigness of an idea by how many trillions of dollars it adds to the budget or the boldness of an idea by how many fellow Americans it can antagonize.",
            "Well, I\u00edve made clear that this will be a topic of day one action, and this is not theoretical for me. I live in one of those river cities that you\u00edre talking about. Not only that, I live right by the river. My neighborhood flooded in the second of two once in a millennium floods that we had in two years. Do the math on that so I know what\u00eds at stake and it\u00eds why I insist that we act with a carbon tax and dividend with massive increases in renewable research on renewable energy, energy storage and carbon storage. But bigger than that, you have to summon the energies of the entire country to deal with this.",
            "I\u00edve seen politicians in Washington saying the right thing about climate change for as long as I\u00edve been alive. All these plans we have to get carbon neutral by 2050, and I think most or all of us have one. Their impact is multiplied by zero unless something actually gets done.",
            "And that is why I want to make sure that our vision for climate includes people from the auto worker down the block from me in South Bend, to a farmer a few minutes away, so that they understand that we are asking, recruiting them to be part of the solution.",

            "What we are seeing in the Middle East and around the world are the consequences of this president\u00eds failure, this president\u00eds refusal to lead. It\u00eds particularly disturbing in the case of Israel because he has infused domestic politics, making US foreign policy choices in order to effectively interfere in Israeli domestic politics. Acting as though that somehow makes him pro- Israel and pro- Jewish while welcoming white nationalists into The White House.",
            "But it\u00eds not only in the Middle East that we see the consequences of the disappearance of US leadership. We see among our allies and among our adversaries, case after case, where the world is making plans on what to do, ignoring the United States because we\u00edre no longer considered reliable. It\u00eds not just the mockery at a cocktail party on the sidelines of a conference, it\u00eds the looks on the faces of the leaders at the UN as they looked at the United States President with a mixture of contempt and pity.",
            "As an American, I never again want to see the American President looked at that way by the leaders of the world. The world needs America right now, but it can\u00edt be just any American. It has to be one that is actually living up to the values that make us who we are. Supporting peace, supporting democracy, supporting human rights and supporting stability around the world.",
            "I think that any tool ought to be on the table, especially diplomatic, economic and social tools like what you\u00edre describing. Look, for the president to let it be known that his silence, whether it\u00eds on the rounding up of Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, putting them into camps, or the aspirations of the people of Hong Kong for democracy. For him to let China know that his silence can be purchased is trashing American values. The reality is that there\u00eds a lot more to the relationship with China than who\u00eds selling more dishwashers? Yes, we need a much smarter trade policy.",
            "We also have to acknowledge what\u00eds going on over there. The use of technology for the perfection of dictatorship. That is going to require a stronger than ever response from the US in defense of democracy. But when folks out there standing up for democracy hear not a peep from the President of the United States, what message is that sending to the Chinese Communist Party? The message I will send is that if they perpetrate a repeat of anything like Tienanmen Square when it comes to Hong Kong, they will be isolated from the free world and we will lead that isolation diplomatically and economically.",
            "I\u00edm actually not worried about the president\u00eds bad sense of humor when it comes to being made fun of. I\u00edm worried about the fact that he is echoing the vocabulary of dictators around the world. When the American president refers to unfavorable press coverage as the product of the enemy of the people, democracy around the world gets weaker. Freedom of the press, not just here at home but around the world, gets weaker. It\u00eds one more reminder of what is at stake, not just here at home, but for world history, in the imperative that we win this election.",

Donald Trump and his allies have made it abundantly clear that they will stop at nothing, not even foreign interference, to hold on to power. They\u00edve already put together more than $300 million. This is our chance. This is our only chance to defeat Donald Trump. And we shouldn\u00edt try to do it with one hand tied behind our back. The way we\u00edre going to win is to bring everybody to our side in this fight. If that means that you\u00edre a grad student digging deep to go online to peteforamerica.com and chip in 10 bucks, that\u00eds great. And if you can drop $1,000 without blinking, that\u00eds great too. We need everybody\u00eds help in this fight. I\u00edm not going to turn away anyone who wants to help us defeat Donald Trump. We need Democrats who\u00edve been with us all along, yes, but we also need independents worried about the direction of the country. If you were Republican, disgusted with what\u00eds going on in your own party, we\u00edre not going to agree on everything, but we need you in this fight and I will welcome you to our side.",

Senator, your net worth is 100 times mine. Now, supposing that you went home feeling the holiday spirit, I know this isn\u00edt likely but stay with me, and decided to go on to Pete for america.com and give the maximum allowable by law $2,800.

But also, Senator, your presidential campaign right now as we speak, is funded in part by money you transferred, having raised it at those exact same big ticket fundraisers you now denounce. Did it corrupt you, Senator? Of course not. So, to denounce the same kind of fundraising guidelines that president Obama went by, that Speaker Pelosi goes by, that you yourself went by until not long ago in order to build the democratic party and build a campaign ready for the fight of our lives, these purity tests shrink the stakes of the most important election upon us.",
            "Yes, and they should have a fast track to citizenship because what the United States did under this president to them was wrong and we have a moral obligation to make right what was broken. And on the larger issue of immigration, my understanding of this issue isn\u00edt theoretical. It\u00eds not something I formed in committee rooms in Washington. It begins with the fact that my household, my family came from abroad. My father immigrated to this country and became a U.S. Citizen. It comes from the fact that I\u00edm the mayor of a city where neighborhoods that were left for dying are now coming back to life, largely because of the contributions mainly of Latino immigrants.",

How can harming that young man possibly make America safer.",
            "When I am president?

            "I support H.R. 40 which is the bill that has been proposed in Congress to establish a commission to look at reparations, but we shouldn\u00edt wait for that commission to do its work to do things that are reparative. Remember we\u00edre not talking about a gift to anybody. We\u00edre talking about mending what was broken. We\u00edre talking about the generational theft of the wealth of generations of African Americans. And just crossing out or racist policy and replacing it with a neutral one is not enough to deliver a quality harms compound just like a dollar saved in its value compounds over time. So does the value of a dollar stolen and that is why the United States must act immediately with investments in minority owned businesses with investments in health equity, with investments in HBCUs and on the longer term a look at reparations so that we can mend what has been broken.",

            "You\u00edre right, and before the break you seemed to imply that my relationship to the First Amendment was a talking point. As if anyone up here has any more or less commitment to the constitution than anybody else up here. Let me tell you about my relationship to the First Amendment. It is part of the Constitution that I raised my right hand and swore to defend with my life. That is my experience and it may not be the same as yours, but it counts, senator, it counts.",
            "I\u00edve got to respond to that. Senator I know that if you just go by vote totals, maybe what goes on in my city seems small to you. If you want to talk about the capacity to win, try putting together a coalition to bring you back to office with 80% of the vote as a gay dude and Mike Pence\u00eds Indiana.",
            "I do think that if you\u00edre in that lucky top 10% I still wish you, well, don\u00edt get me wrong, I just want you to go ahead and pay your own tuition. Now we can still have public service loan forgiveness for those who go into lower income fields to deal with that. But if you\u00edre not top 10% I think you\u00edre going to be for the most part. Okay? And there is a very real choice on where every one of these tax dollars goes. So I very much agree with Senator Warren on raising more tax revenue from millionaires and billionaires. I just don\u00edt agree on the part about spending it on millionaires and billionaires when it comes to their college tuition.",
            "The Supreme court is very personal for me because my household, my marriage, exists by the grace of a single vote on that body, and yes, it is critical that we have justices who understand that American freedom includes reproductive rights and reproductive freedom, but that\u00eds not all. I expect an understanding that voting rights are human rights. I expect an understanding that equality is required of us all and I expect a level of respect for the rule of law that prevents this body from coming to be viewed as just one more partisan battlefield, which is why I will not only appoint judges and justices who reflect this worldview, but also begin moving to reform the body itself as our country has done at least half a dozen times in its history. So that it is not one more political battlefield every single time a vacancy comes up.",
            "We\u00edre going to leave one way or the other. The question is to make sure we do it well and not poorly. And of course that has to respond to the conditions on the ground and the need for a political settlement. But the other day I was reunited with somebody that I served with over there and the thing we were, marveling at is how long it\u00eds been since we left. I thought I was one of the last troops turning out the lights when I left years ago and we\u00edre still there. There may need to be some kind of limited special operations and intelligence capacity. The exact same kind of thing by the way that we actually had in Syria, holding the line before the president yanked it out leading to the road to chaos. But what we know is that we cannot go on with these endless wars.",
            "And I\u00edm glad that the name of Barbara Lee was mentioned, not only because of what she\u00eds talked about years ago. I believe that we had no choice but to go to Afghanistan after 9/11 but right now, she is one of the leaders of the effort to repeal and replace the authorization for the use of military force and the folks that I served with deserve that. They deserve the clarity of members of Congress being able to summon the courage, to take an up or down vote on whether they ought to be there in the first place and when I am president, anytime if I am forced to deploy troops into war, anytime we seek an authorization, it will have a three year sunset. So that if there really does have to be a conversation about extending it, it has to be brought to Congress, brought to the American people, and those members of Congress have to take that tough up or down vote.",
            "Well, first of all, I love data and books, so I think we should all be excited about this. And come to think of it, I should probably send my book around more to. Look. I think all of us want the same thing at the end of the day. We know what a gift it would be to the future and to the country for literally anybody up here to become president of The United States compared to what we\u00edve got. And we got to remember there. I don\u00edt know how many, now we\u00edre up to 25 something, have run for president in the democratic party. The moment we\u00edve got a nominee, the 24 who aren\u00edt that nominee are going to have to rally around the one who does. Let\u00eds make sure there\u00eds not too much to ask for forgiveness for by the time that day comes.",
            "So the nominee is going to have to do two things, defeat Donald Trump, and unite the country as president. It\u00eds a tall order. And in order to do it, we\u00edre going to need a nominee and a president who can respond to the crisis of belonging that is gripping our nation today. That means building up a politics that is defined, not by who we exclude, not by who we reject, but by how many people we can call to this side. I have seen so many people capable of forming that multiracial, multi generational coalition and I\u00edm seeing more and more people who maybe have not felt welcome in the Democratic party before, but belong here now, because they\u00edre definitely not on board with what\u00eds going on in the Trump white house. I am asking you to join me, to vote for me to caucus for me and to help us build that future defined not by exclusion but by belonging."

            "Let me make the case to the American people. As a wise judge said, \u00ecThe president is not king in America; the law is king.\u00ee And what James Madison once said when he was speaking out at the constitutional convention, and by the way I think he\u00eds a pretty good size for a president, he was five foot four. And what he said, he said the reason that we have these impeachment articles in the constitution, that the provisions are in there, is because he feared that a president would betray the trust of the American people for a foreign power. That is what happened here. Watergate. This is a global Watergate. In the case of Watergate, a paranoid president facing election looked for dirt on a political opponent. He did it by getting people to break in. This president did it by calling a foreign leader to look for dirt on a political opponent.",
            "And I would make this case: as we face his trial in the Senate, if the president claims that he is so innocent, then why doesn\u00edt he have all the president\u00eds men testify? Richard Nixon had his top people testify. We should be hearing from Mulvaney, who is the one under oath. Witnesses have said that Mulvaney is the one that said, \u00ecOkay, we\u00edre going to withhold this aid to a fledgling democracy to get dirt on a political opponent.\u00ee We should hear from Bolden, who told his own staff to go see a lawyer after they met with the president. That is the case. If President Trump thinks that he should not be impeached, he should be not scared to put forward his own witnesses.",
            "I have a different view. I\u00edll go with my friend Sherrod Brown, who has voted against every trade agreement that\u00eds come in front of him, and he\u00eds voting for this, and I am too. And the reason I am voting for it is that I believe that we have a change with this agreement. I would not have voted for the agreement that President Trump put forward, but we\u00edve got better labor standards, better environmental standards, and a better deal when it comes to the pharmaceutical provision, which I also oppose.",
            "95 percent of our customers are outside of our borders, and we have to make sure that we have trade agreements that are more fair, because if we can encourage work made in America, every time you hold something in your hand that says \u00ecmade in America,\u00ee it is the ingenuity of our workers. It is equality of a product, it is equality of our workers, and it is the hopes and dreams of the American people. I think this agreement, while Senator Sanders is correct, there are some issues with it, is much better than the one originally proposed. And for those farmers in the Midwest, and for those people that have been hurt by the fact that we will not have a trade segment with Mexico and with Canada and the United States, I think that this is a much better deal.",

            "We cannot wait to act. There\u00eds an Ojibwe saying that great leaders make decisions, not for this generation, but seven generations from now. This president doesn\u00edt keep his decisions for seven minutes. So what I think we need to do get back into the International Climate Change Agreement. I will do that on day one. On day two, bring back the clean power rules on day three, the gas mileage standards. I see the governor of California who has been working so hard to get those done, defied every step of the way by the Trump administration. And then introduced sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and build a fridge to the next century, which means we must upgrade our buildings and our building standards.",
            "I wanted to add to what Elizabeth said. So the way we tackle this corruption is by winning big in this election and the way we take on climate change in a big way is by yes, talking about what\u00eds happening on the coast is I just did, but also talking about what\u00eds happening in the Midwest, where I\u00edm from. It\u00eds not fly over country to me, I live there. And what we are seeing there is unprecedented flooding. We\u00edre seeing an increase. 50% increase in homeowners insurance over the last few years and when we make these changes, we have to make clear to people that when we put a price on carbon that that money is going to come back to those areas where people are going to be hurt, where jobs are going to change and to make them whole with their energy bills. When you make the case like that, you bring in the Midwestern votes, you win big, and I think the best way to do it is by putting someone at the top of the ticket who\u00eds from the Midwest.",

Our constitution says that we strive for a more perfect union. Well that\u00eds what we are in doing right now. And to me that means, one, that everyone can vote, and that includes our communities of color. This action that\u00eds been taken by this president and his people and his governors all over the country is wrong. They have made it harder for African Americans to vote. As one court said, \u00ecDiscriminated with surgical precision.\u00ee",

Because you don\u00edt go to a church or synagogue or a mosque for three months, you don\u00edt lose your right to worship. You shouldn\u00edt lose your right to vote. I would pass, as president, my bill to register every kid in this country when they turn 18 to vote. That would make all of these discriminatory actions in these states go away and I would stop the gerrymandering, in addition to the agenda of economic opportunity. Because as Martin Luther King says, \u00ecWhat good is it to integrate a lunch counter if you can\u00edt afford a hamburger?\u00ee",
            "When it comes to foreign policy, I think we need to keep our promises and keep our threats. And this president has done neither. And a country like China, they\u00edre leaders, they watch that and they know. He has stood with dictators over innocents. He has stood with tyrants over free leaders. He does it all the time. And I have a little different take than some of my colleagues when it comes to what happened at that conference with NATO. Yeah, they were making fun of him, some of the foreign leaders. I\u00edve heard senators make more fun of other senators than that. The point of it was that he couldn\u00edt even tolerate it. He is so thin skinned that he walked, he quit. America doesn\u00edt quit.",

And I am the one that asked every attorney general candidate we\u00edve had under Donald Trump, both of whom I opposed, about their respect for the First Amendment. And they have refused to follow the rules that Attorney General Holder put in place when it came to protecting our journalists. They would not commit that they wouldn\u00edt put a journalist in jail for doing their job. So this is not just talking points to me, this is the real world. And I think that experience that I will bring to The White House with protecting the First Amendment is worth more than any talking points.",
            "Thank you for asking a woman this question. First of all, we have not had enough women in our government. When I was on Trevor Noah\u00eds show once, I explained how in the history of the Senate, there was something like 2000 men and only 50 women in the whole history and he said if a nightclub had numbers that bad, they would shut it down. However, it is not just about numbers. It\u00eds about what you get done. And that is my argument. If you look at the poll at the state that knows me best, and that is the state of Minnesota, it showed in the state that Hillary had her lowest margin of victory. It showed that I beat Donald Trump by 18 points. I beat him with men more than anyone on this stage. So, I think what matters in this election is can you bring in those rural and suburban areas, particularly in the Midwest? And number two, what will you do when you get there?",

I\u00edve been to the Wind Cave in South Dakota, which I suggest you go to. So, what is making a case for progress about? That is what unites us up here instead of what divides us, which is campaign finance reform. That means passing a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. It means making the first bill we pass when I am president will be HR1 which is the ethics reform passed in the house, which is currently sitting on Mitch McConnell\u00eds desk along with 400 bills. And if you don\u00edt think we can get this done, well we can, but only if we win this election big. Not by arguing with each other but by finding what united us in getting it done.

He has used our immigrants as political pawns. Every single day, he tries to draw a wedge. I will be a different president. My view on this comes from experience. When I got to the Senate, Senator Kennedy asked me to be one of the two new senators that was in the group to work on the immigration reform package. We got so close to passing that. I voted for it. Not everyone did, but most of the Democrats did. Then I was on the judiciary committee when President Obama was president and we worked very hard on that immigration reform. We actually passed that with Republican votes. Then I was in the small group that worked on the compromise on the DREAMers, that would have solved that problem. We didn\u00edt get that done because this president gut-punched us.",

When we were in the last debate mayor, you basically mocked the 100 years of experience on the stage and what do I see on this stage? I see Elizabeth\u00eds work starting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and helping 29 million people. I see the vice president\u00eds work in getting a $2 billion for his cancer moonshot. I see Senator Sanders\u00ed work working to get the veterans bill passed across the aisle and I see what I\u00edve done, which is to negotiate three farm bills and be someone that actually had major provisions put in those bills. So what you can dismiss committee hearings. I think this experience works and I have not denigrated your experience as a local official. I have been one-",

This is about choosing a president and I know my view of this is I know you ran for to be chair of the Democratic National Committee. That\u00eds not something that I wanted to do. I want to be president of the United States. And the point is we should have someone heading up this ticket that has actually won and been able to show that they can gather the support that you talk about of moderate Republicans and Independents as well as a fired-up democratic base. And not just done at once, I have done it three times. I think winning matters. I think a track record of getting things done matters and I also think showing our party that we can actually bring people with us, have a wider tent, have a bigger coalition and yes, longer coattails that matters.",

As for the judge you just referred to, there was actually the judge that wrote the opinion was a, that went through the Senate unanimously with support by Senator Sanders with support by President Obama with support by then Senator Kennedy. So I think it is very important when we look at these judges to acknowledge that there are some of these judges that you think are going to be okay and they aren\u00edt, but what would I do as president? I would appoint judges that are in the vein of people like Elena Kagan and justice Pryor and Sonia Sotomayor, and let\u00eds not forget the notorious RBG. That\u00eds what I would do.",
            "And if you look at my record as a lawyer and a member of the Judiciary committee, look at the judges that I recommended to President Obama. People like Mimi Wright who\u00eds a superstar, and Susan Richard Nelson, look at who I put in as the first openly gay Marshall in the history of the United States. I did that because I knew they were qualified people to take those jobs and you need to do it not only with the right judges and have that knowhow, but you also have to do it right away. That is one thing that we all learn from when president Obama was in and that was that he was dealing with an economic crisis and it was hard to do it right away, but we have to immediately start putting judges on the bench to fill vacancies so that we can reverse the horrific nature of these Trump judges.",

            "Thank you, Senator. Mayor Buttigieg, you served in this war, but I want to ask about your decision making if you were elected Commander in Chief. You have pledged to withdrawal all U.S. troops from a Afghanistan within your first year as president. But the Taliban today control or contest more than half the country. So should you, as president, still withdrawal all those U. S. Troops if the country could once again become a Haven for terrorists.",

But where I disagree is, I just don\u00edt think anyone has a monopoly on bold ideas. I think you can be progressive and practical at the same time. That is why I favor a public option, which is a nonprofit option to bring the cost down and yes, it does bring the cost down immediately for 13 million people and then we\u00edll expand coverage to 12 million people.",

It is with the new governor, democratic governor of Kentucky that wants to build on Obamacare.

We need a leader who can bring people together and who can win that way. So if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me.

            "Well, Judy, what I would say is that we have a president who is a pathological liar. We have a president who is running the most corrupt administration in the modern history of this country. And we have a president who is a fraud, because during his campaign he told working people one thing, and he ended up doing something else. I believe, and I will personally be doing this in the coming weeks and months, is making the case that we have a president who has sold out the working families of this country, who wants to cut social security, Medicare, and Medicaid, after he promised he would not do that, and who has documentedly lied thousands of times since he is president. And the case to be made is, yeah, certainly, I disagree with Trump on virtually all of his policies, but what conservatives, I think, understand, is that we cannot have a president with that temperament, who is dishonoring the presidency of the United States.",
            "Judy, you\u00edre talking to somebody who, unlike some of my colleagues here, voted against NAFTA, voted against PNC [inaudible 00:11:45] with China, two agreements that cost us over four million decent-paying jobs. Now, I don\u00edt agree with the, your statement that people think this is going to be a great job creator. This is a modest improvement over what we have right now. It would allow, hopefully, Mexican workers to organize into unions or independent unions, and be able to negotiate decent contracts. But at the end of the day, in my view, it is not going to stop outsourcing. It is not going to stop corporations from moving to Mexico, where manufacturing workers make less than two dollars an hour. What we need is a trade policy that stands up for workers, stands up for farmers, and, by the way, the word \u00ecclimate change,\u00ee to the best of my knowledge, is not discussed in this new NAFTA agreement at all, which is an outrage. So no, I will not be voting for this agreement, although it makes some modest improvements.",

One point one percent. That ain\u00edt great. Tonight, while three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America, 500,000 Americans, including 30,000 veterans are sleeping out on the streets. Today in America, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth, more income and wealth inequality since the 1920s. We need an economy that works for working families, not just the 1 percent. That is what our campaign is about.",
            "Tim, in all due respect, your question misses the mark. It is not an issue of relocating people in towns. The issue now is whether we save the planet for our children and our grandchildren. The issue, as you should know, what the scientists are telling us, is they have underestimated the threat and severity of climate change. You\u00edre talking about the Paris Agreement, that\u00eds fine. Ain\u00edt enough. We have got to, and I\u00edve introduced legislation to do this, declare a national emergency. The United States has got to lead the world and maybe, just maybe, instead of spending 1.8 trillion a year globally on weapons of destruction, maybe an American president, i.e. Bernie Sanders can lead the world. Instead of spending money to kill each other, maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change.",

            "I certainly can because people of color, in fact, are going to be the people suffering most if we do not deal with climate change. And by the way, we have an obligation up here if there are not any of our African American brothers and sisters up here, to speak about an economy in which African Americans are exploited, where black women die three times at higher rates than white women, where we have a criminal justice system which is racist and broken, disproportionately made up of African Americans and Latinos and Native Americans who are in jail. So we need an economy that focuses on the needs of oppressed, exploited people and that is the African American community.",

The issue is where power resides in America and it\u00eds not white or black or male or female. We are living in a nation increasingly becoming an oligarchy, where you have a handful of billionaires who spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and politicians. You have more income and wealth inequality today than at any time since the 1920s. We are the only major country on earth, not to guarantee healthcare for all people, which is why we need Medicare for all. We are facing an existential crisis of climate change. The issue is not old or young, male or female. The issue is working people standing up, taking on the billionaire class, and creating a government and an economy that works for all, not just the 1%.",

Now there\u00eds a real competition going on up here. My good friend Joe, and he is a good friend, he\u00eds received contributions from 44 billionaires. Pete, on the other hand is trailing. Pete, you only got 39 billionaires contributing. So Pete, we look forward to you. I know you\u00edre an energetic guy and a competitive guy to see if you could take on Joe on that issue. But what is not a laughing matter, my friends. This is why three people own more wealth than the bottom half. This is why Amazon and other major corporations pay zero in federal taxes.

Day one we introduce bipartisan legislation, which will, in fact, be comprehensive, which will result in a path toward citizenship for all of the 11 million who are undocumented. That is what the people of our country want. Trump thinks mistakenly that he is going to win reelection by dividing us up.

So let me tell you how you\u00edre win it. You have the largest voter turnout in the history of America. And you don\u00edt have the largest voter turnout unless you create energy and excitement. And you know, create energy and excitement unless you are prepared to take on the people who own America and are prepared to speak to the people who are working in America.

I think what we have to do is what we do with social security, what we do with public education. Donald Trump\u00eds kids can go to a public school, they should be able to go to a public school. What we all need right now is a revolution in education. We have got to en this dysfunctional childcare system and make that every working class person in this country can find high quality, affordable childcare.

What we also need for the transgender community is to make sure that health care is available to every person in this country, regardless of their sexual orientation or their needs.

That family is now paying $12,000 a year for health care. 20% of the income or the Medicare for all that family will be paying $1,200 a year because we\u00edre eliminating the profiteering of the drug companies and the insurance companies and ending, there\u00eds Byzantine and complex administration of thousands of separate healthcare plans.",

We all got to increase personal taxes, but we\u00edre eliminating premiums, we\u00edre eliminating copayments, we\u00edre eliminating deductibles, we\u00edre eliminating all out of pocket expenses and no family in America will spend more than $200 a year on prescription drugs.

So when I think about the gift that I\u00edd like to give, and I\u00edve seen that too. I mean I think it starts with cruelty.

How are we going to stand up for the people of the United States together? Not by tearing each other down, but by supporting each other and by realizing that what we stand for is the true value of America. And as a team that\u00eds how we\u00edre going to do it.

This president has made corruption, originally, his argument, that he would drain the swamp. And yet he came to Washington, broke that promise, and has done everything he can for the wealthy and the well-connected, from tax breaks to ambassadorships. We have to prosecute the case against him, and that means we need a candidate for president who can draw the sharpest distinction between the corruption of the Trump administration and a Democrat who is willing to get out and fight, not for the wealthy and well-connected, but to fight for everyone else.

We have a government that works great for giant drug companies, just not for someone trying to fill a prescription. Works great for people who want to make money at private prisons and private detention centers at our border, just not for the people whose lives are torn apart. Works great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, but not for the rest of us, who see climate change bearing down upon us.

Because they have AI technology that now is using facial recognition to identify protesters if they so much as do anything on the street so they can follow up with them and detain them later. This is the rivalry that we have to win where China\u00eds concerned. They\u00edre in the process of leapfrogging us in AI because they have more data than we do and their government is subsidizing it to the tune of tens of billions of dollars.",
            "I have sat with our leading technologists and they say they cannot match the Chinese resources. China just produced its first major smartphone that does not have Google apps and it is now trying to export its technology to the rest of the world. What we have to do is build an international coalition to set technology standards and then you can bring the Chinese to the table in a very real way because this is their top priority and this is where we need to out compete them and win.",

I just want to return to this conversation because I think it\u00eds core. Our country is deeply misogynist and most all of us know that. Money and men are tied together. That\u00eds where I thought Elizabeth was taking the conversation. The fact is, strong societies would elect more female leaders. Strong men treat women well for the same reasons. I\u00edm on the record saying that you need both strong men and female leaders in government because the fact is if you get too many men alone and leave us alone for a while, we kind of become morons.",
            "So, it\u00eds related to our campaign finance rules because right now the fact is we operate in a fundamentally anti-woman marketplace, and that includes the marketplace for politicians. If we were to put a hundred democracy dollars into the hands of every American voter, instead of 5% contributing, you\u00edd see that rate skyrocket to 50 or 60% and you\u00edd have many, many more women who would run for office because they don\u00edt have to go shake the money tree in the wine cave.",
            "I believe everyone on this stage would do the right thing by DREAMers in the first hundred days. I would make it a top priority. I\u00edm the son of immigrants myself. The fact is almost half of fortune 500 companies were started by an immigrant or children of immigrants. Immigrants make our country stronger and more dynamic. And immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have absolutely nothing to do with. If you go to the factory in Michigan, it\u00eds not wall to wall immigrants. It\u00eds wall to wall robot arms and machines. We have to send the opposite message of this administration and, as your a president, I think I could send a very clear message, where if you\u00edre considering immigrating to this country and I\u00edm the president, you would realize my son or daughter can become president of the United States. That\u00eds the opposite of the current administration and that\u00eds the message I would love to send to the world.",

How many of you all have a family member or a friend or a neighbor with special needs or autism? If you look around, most hands went up. The fact is right now we have to do more for Kyle. Special needs children are going to become special needs adults in many cases. And here\u00eds the challenge. We go to employers and say, Hey, this special needs person can be a contributor in your workplace, which may be correct, but that\u00eds not the point. We have to stop confusing economic value in human value. We have to be able to say to our kids and Kyle that you have intrinsic value because you are an American and you are a human being.",
            "We\u00edre going to put a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month in everyone\u00eds hands, which is going to help families around the country adapt and then we\u00edre going to take this burden off of the communities and off of the schools who do not have the resources to support kids like my son and make it a federal priority, not a local one. So not not robbing Peter to pay Paul.",

I spent seven years helping create thousands of jobs in Detroit, Baltimore, New Orleans and other cities, serving as an ambassador of entrepreneurship under President Obama, and I saw firsthand what many of you already know, our country is falling apart. Our senior citizens are working until the day they die. Our kids are addicted to smartphones or drugs. We\u00edre seeing record high levels of depression, suicides, overdoses. Our companies are recording record profits while our people are literally dying younger. Our way of life is changing faster than ever. And the simple fact is this, our politicians in D C succeed whether we the people succeed or fail. Washington DC today is the richest city in our country. What do they produce? Bad decisions? We need to get the money out of DC and into your hands, the hands of the American people. Join us in Yang2020.com and help us rewrite the rules of the 20th century economy to work for us."

It was a mistake and I acknowledged that. But the man who also argued against that war, Barack Obama picked me to be his Vice President and once we were elected President, and Vice President, he turned to me and asked me to end that war. I know what it\u00eds like to send a son or daughter and like our colleague has gone to war in Afghanistan, my son for a year in Iraq and that\u00eds why I do it very, very reluctantly.",
            "That\u00eds why I led the effort as you know, Wolf against surging tens of thousands of troops into Afghanistan. We should not send anyone anywhere unless the overwhelming vital interest of United States are at stake. They were not at stake there. They were not at stake in Iraq and it was a mistaken vote. But I think my record overall on every other thing we\u00edve done has been\u00d6 I\u00edm prepared to compare it to anybody\u00eds on this stage.",
            "I was asked to bring 156,000 troops home from that war, which I did. I led that effort. It was a mistake to trust that they weren\u00edt going to go to war. They said they were not going to go to war. They said they were just going to get inspectors in. The world, in fact voted to send inspectors in and they still went to war. From that point on, I was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake and from that point on, I moved to bring those troops home.",
            "I was part of that deal to get the nuclear agreement with Iran, bringing together the rest of the world and including some of the folks who aren\u00edt friendly to us and it was working. It was working, it was being held tightly. There was no movement on the part of the Iranian government to get closer to a nuclear weapon. And look what\u00eds happened, he went ahead and it was predictable from the day he pulled out of the agreement, Trump, what exactly would happened. We\u00edre now isolated. We\u00edre in a situation where our allies in Europe are making a comparison between the United States and Iran, saying both ought to stand down, making a moral equivalence. We have lost our standing in the region, we have lost the support of our allies. The next President has to be able to pull those folks back together, re-establish our alliances and insist that Iran go back into the agreement, which I believe with the pressure applied as we put on before we can get done.",
            "I would leave troops in the Middle East in terms of patrolling the Gulf, where we are now, small numbers of troops. And I think it\u00eds a mistake to pull out the small number of troops that are there now to deal with ISIS. What\u00eds happened is, now that he\u00eds gone ahead, the President and started this whole process moving, what\u00eds happening? ISIS is going to reconstitute itself. We\u00edre in a position where we have to pull our forces out. Americans have to leave the entire region and quite frank, I think he\u00eds flat out lied about saying the reason he made the strike was because our embassies were about to be bombed.",
            "Well, I\u00edll tell you what. There\u00eds a difference between combat troops and leaving special forces in a position. I was part of the coalition that put together 68 countries to deal with stateless terror, as well as failed States, not us alone, 68 other countries. That\u00eds how we were able to defeat and end the caliphate for ISIS. They\u00edll come back if we do not deal with them and we do not have someone who can bring together the rest of the world to go with us, with small numbers of special forces we have, to organize the effort to take them down.",

The informed consent of the American people. And with regard to this idea that we can walk away and not have any troops anywhere, excluding special forces, there\u00eds no way you negotiate or been able to negotiate with terrorists. You have to be able to form coalitions, to be able to defeat them or contain them.",

So that\u00eds a fundamental difference than negotiating with other countries, it\u00eds fundamentally a requirement that we use our special forces in small numbers to coordinate with other countries to bring together coalitions.",
            "No, there was the authorization for the use of military force that was passed by the United States Congress House and Senate and signed by the President. That was the authority, does not give authority to go into Iran, it gave authority to deal with these other issues.",
            "Exactly. We tried that.",
            "No, not now. I wouldn\u00edt meet with him without any preconditions. Look, we gave him everything he\u00eds looking for. Legitimacy, the President showed up, met with him, gave him legitimacy, weakened the sanctions we have against them. I would be putting what I did as Vice President. I\u00edve met with Xi Jinping more than anyone else. I would be putting pressure on China to put pressure on Korea, to cease and desist from their nuclear power, make their efforts to deal with nuclear weapons. I would move forward as we did before and you reported it extensively Wolf, about moving forward the whole notion of defense against nuclear weapons.",
            "And when China said to me, when Xi Jinping said to me, \u00ecThat\u00eds a threat to us.\u00ee I said, \u00ecWe\u00edre going to move and protect our interests unless you get involved and protect it.\u00ee I would re-ignite the relationship between Japan and South Korea and I would put enormous pressure on China because it\u00eds also in their interest for them to put pressure on North Korea to cease and desist. But I would not meet with absent preconditions. I would not meet with the \u00ecSupreme leader\u00ee who said, \u00ecJoe Biden is a rabid dog. He should be beaten to death with a stick.\u00ee I count that.",

We should be putting our money and our effort and our time in preparing America workers to compete in the 21st century on the high- tech side, dealing with artificial intelligence. We should be focusing on equipping American workers to do that.",
            "By the way, the idea \u00d6 I don\u00edt know that there\u00eds any trade agreement that the senator would ever think made any sense, but the problem is that 95% of the customers are out there. So we\u00edve got to figure out how we begin to write the rules of the road, not China.",

That\u00eds one of the things that has been improved with the trade agreement with Mexico, and that\u00eds what we should be doing in any agreement we have.",
            "But let\u00eds get back to the basics here. If we don\u00edt set the rules of the road by going out to our partners, instead of poking our finger in the eye of all our friends and allies. We make up 25% of the world\u00eds economy. We\u00edve got to bring the other 25% of our allies along with us to set the rules of the road so China cannot continue to abuse their power by stealing an actual are stealing our intellectual property and doing all the other things using their corporate state system to our significant disadvantage.",

But the real issue is who can bring the whole party together and represent all elements of the party, African Americans, brown, black, women, men, gay, straight? The fact of the matter is that I would argue that, in terms of endorsements around the country, endorsements wherever we go, I am the one who has the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race.",
            "I think we need to be candid with voters. I think we have to tell them what we\u00edre going to do and what it\u00eds going to cost, and a 4% tax on income over $24,000 doesn\u00edt even come close to paying for between 30 and some estimates as high as $40 trillion over ten years. That\u00eds doubling the entire federal budget per year.",
            "There\u00eds a way to do that. The way to do that is to take Obamacare, re-instate, rebuild it, provide a public option, allow Medicare for those folks who want it, and, in fact, make sure that we, in the process, reduce the costs of drug prices, reduce the cost of being able to buy into the \u00d6 subsidize it further, and make it available to everyone. Here\u00eds the deal. That costs a lot of money that cost $740 billion over ten years. I lay out how I pay for that.",
            "You can do it without Medicare for All. You can get the same place.",
            "The [inaudible 01:00:41] my layout does, in fact, limit drug costs. It allows all the drug companies to \u00d6 Excuse me, it allows Medicare to negotiate with drug companies for the price. It\u00eds sets a system whereby you cannot raise the price of a drug beyond the cost of medical inflation. By the way, there\u00eds mental health parity that I call for in the Obamacare expanded with the Biden option.",
            "I would argue that the biggest breakthrough in recent time was us being able to do in our administration what five Democratic presidents couldn\u00edt get done, and that is pass Obamacare. It was a big deal. Secondly, I would argue that the way you control drug prices is you limit what they can charge for those prices, you don\u00edt have to pay the price. Limit what they can charge. If in fact they charge more than we set the price for, in fact, people can import from abroad assuming that it is safe. We in fact\u00d6 It\u00eds only yellow. Okay? And we can in fact do all of this and still provide people the option to stay the roughly 150 to 160 million Americans who like the negotiated plan they have with their employers, if they don\u00edt like it or the employer gets rid of it, they can buy into a Medicare plan in the Biden plan.",
            "There should be free, universal infant care, but here\u00eds the deal. I was a single parent too when my wife and daughter were killed. My two boys I had to raise. I was a young Senator. I just hadn\u00edt been sworn in yet, and I was making $42,000 a year. I commuted every single solitary day to Wilmington, Delaware over 500 miles a day. Excuse me, 250 miles a day because I could not afford, but for my family, childcare. It was beyond my reach to be able to do it and that\u00eds why there\u00eds several things we do.",
            "When I tripled the amount of money for title one schools, every child three, four and five-years-old will in fact have full schooling. They\u00edll go to school and after school programs, which will release some of the burden. Secondly, I think we should have an $8,000 tax credit, which would put 7 million women back to work. They could afford to go to work and still care for their children as an $8,000 tax credit. I also believe that we should, in fact, for people who in fact are not able to afford any of the infant care to be able to get that care. But Bernie\u00eds right. We have to raise the salaries of the people who are doing the care, and I provide for that as well. My time is up. I know, but I\u00edm not going to go over like everybody.",
            "It\u00eds irrelevant. There\u00eds no choice but for Nancy Pelosi and the House to move. He has in fact committed impeachable offenses. Whether the Senate makes that judgment or not is for them to decide, and by the way, I\u00edm told that I say we have to unite the country. It\u00eds going to be harder after this trial. It may be, but look, you know, I understand how these guys are, this Republican party. They\u00edve gone after, Savage, my surviving son. Gone after me, told lies that your networks and others won\u00edt even carry on television because they\u00edre flat out lies, and I did my job. The question is whether or not he did his job. And he hasn\u00edt done his job, and so it doesn\u00edt really matter whether or not he\u00eds going after me, I\u00edve got to be in a position that I think of the American people. I can\u00edt hold a grudge. I have to be able to not only fight, but also heal, and as president of the United States, that\u00eds what I will attempt to do, not withstanding that we\u00edre going to be more division after he\u00eds defeated by me this next time.",
            "My response is back in 1986, I introduced the first climate change bill and check Politifacts, they said it was a game changer. I\u00edve been fighting this for a long time. I headed up the Recovery Act, which put more money into moving away from fossil fuels to solar and wind energy than ever has occurred in the history of America. Look, what we have to do is we have to act right away and the way we act right away is immediately. If I\u00edm elected president, I\u00edll reinstate all the mileage standards that existed in our administration, which were taken down, that\u00eds 12 billion gallons of gasoline, barrels of gasoline to be saved immediately. And with regard to those folks who in fact are going to be victimized by what\u00eds already happened.

There\u00eds more to say, but I know-",

And by the way, I have overwhelming support from the African American community, overwhelming more than everybody else in this operation, number one. Number two, working class people, where I come from in Pennsylvania and the places I come from in Delaware, I have great support. I have support across the board and I\u00edm not worried about taking on Donald Trump at all. And with regard to the economy, I can hardly wait to have that debate with him. Where I come from, the neighborhoods I come from, they\u00edre in real trouble, working class people and middle class people. When the middle class does well, working class has a way up and the wealthy do well. But what\u00eds happening now? They\u00edre being clobbered, they\u00edre being killed.",

Every single solitary person has to have in a position that may in fact we treat them with decency. It\u00eds about fundamental, basic decency. We in the United States of America can put up with \u00d6 we can overcome four years of Donald Trump, but eight years of Donald Trump will be an absolute disaster and fundamentally change this nation.

We lead the world when we lead by example, not by our power.",

There are enlisted people that I served with, barely old enough to remember those votes on the authorization after 9-11, on the war in Iraq, and there are people now old enough to enlist who were not alive for some of those debates. The next President is going to be confronted with national security challenges, different in scope and in kind from anything we\u00edve seen before.",

It\u00eds going to take a view to the future, as well as the readiness, to learn from the lessons of the past and for me, those lessons of the past are personal.",
            "If we can continue to remain engaged without having an endless commitment of ground troops. But what\u00eds going on right now is the President\u00eds actually sending more. The very President who said he was going to end endless war, who pretended to have been against the war in Iraq all along. But we know that\u00eds not true. Now has more troops going into the Middle East. And whenever I see that happen, I think about the day we shipped out and the time that was set aside for saying goodbye to family members.",

And it took all the strength he had, not to turn around and look at his boy one more time. That is happening by the thousands right now, as we see so many more troops sent into harm\u00eds way.

And it was all pursuant to an authorization that was passed to deal with Al Qaeda and 9-11. And often Congress has been all too happy to leave aside its role. Now thanks to Democrats in Congress, that\u00eds changing. But the reality is year after year, Congress didn\u00edt want to touch this either because it was so politically difficult. Fundamental truth is, if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas into harm\u00eds way, often on deployment after deployment, then we\u00edve got to make sure that Congress has the courage to take tough up or down votes on whether they ought to be there. And when I am President, anytime, which I hope will never happen, but anytime I\u00edm compelled to use force, I seek that authorization. We will have a three year sunset, so that the American people are included not only in the decision about whether to send troops but whether to continue.",

Even less so now after everything that has happened, which is why it will be so critically important to engage leaders, including a lot of new leaders emerging around the world and ensure that we have the alliances we need to meet what I believe is not just an American goal, but a widely shared goal around the world, to ensure that Iran does not become a nuclear armed country.",

Despite this President\u00eds coziness with Vladimir Putin, we actually seem to be further away from being able to work with Russia on things like the renewal of START.

It makes no sense medically because most of us don\u00edt experience the economy on an annual basis. Our bills don\u00edt come in every year. They come in every month.

We can do that and until we do this will be one of the biggest drivers of the gender pay gap because when somebody\u00eds like the the voter asking the question has to step out of the workforce because of that reason, she is at a disadvantage when she comes back in, and that can affect her pay for the rest of her career.",

So what I would do is negotiate, I would bring people together just as President Obama did years ago, and I think that we can get this done.

            "We have spent trillions of dollars on that endless war, money which should go into healthcare and education and infrastructure in this country. Joe and I listened to what Dick Cheney and George Bush and Rumsfeld had to say. I thought they were lying. I didn\u00edt believe them for a moment, I took to the floor I did everything I could to prevent that war. Joe saw it differently.",
            "Okay, let me tell you, but before I tell you that, let me tell you something else. And that is, and I don\u00edt know if my colleagues here will agree with me or not, maybe they will. But what we have to face as a nation is that the two great foreign policy disasters of our lifetimes are the war in Vietnam and the war in Iraq, both of those wars were based on lies. And right now what I fear very much is we have a President who is lying again and could drag us into a war that is even worse than the war in Iraq.",
            "To answer your question, what we need to do is have an international coalition. We cannot keep acting unilaterally. As you know, the nuclear deal with Iran was worked on with a number of our allies. We have got to undo what Trump did, bring that coalition together and make sure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon.",
            "Wolf, in America today, our infrastructure is crumbling. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. 87 million people have no healthcare or are under insured. You got 500,000 people sleeping out on the streets tonight. The American people are sick and tired of endless wars, which have cost us trillions of dollars. Our job is to rebuild the United Nations, rebuild the State department, make sure that we have the capability of bringing the world together to resolve international conflict diplomatically and stop the endless wars that we have experienced.",
            "Other than that, you like him.",
            "The answer is we could do much better than a Trump led trade deal. This deal, and I think the proponents of it acknowledge, will result in the continuation of the loss of hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs, as a result of outsourcing. The heart and soul of our disaster trade agreements and I\u00edm the guy who voted against NAFTA and against permanent normal trade relations with China, is that we have forced American workers to compete against people in Mexico, in China, elsewhere, who earn starvation wages, a dollar or $2 an hour.",
            "Second of all, every major environmental organization has said no to this new trade agreement because it does not even have the phrase climate change in it. And given the fact that climate change is right now the greatest threat facing this planet, I will not vote for a trade agreement that does not incorporate very, very strong principles to significantly lower fossil fuel emissions in the world.",
            "The AFL-CIO does, the machinists union does not. And every environmental organization in this country, including the sunrise organization who are supporting my candidacy, opposes it. So I happen to believe, and I hope we will talk about climate change in a moment. If we do not get our act together in terms of climate change, the planet that we\u00edre going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren will be increasingly unlivable and uninhabitable.",
            "Well they are the same in this issue.",
            "Well, I think that it is not so easy to put together new trade legislation. If this is passed, I think it will set us back a number of years. Senator Warren is right, in saying we need to bring the stakeholders to the table, that is the family farmers here in Iowa and in Vermont and around the country. That is the environmental community, that\u00d6",
            "In Vermont and around the country, that is the environmental community. That is the workers. Bottom line here is I am sick and tired of trade agreements negotiated by the CEOs of large corporations.",
            "Joe and I have a fundamental disagreement, in case you haven\u00edt noticed, and that is NAFTA, PNTR with China, other trade agreements were written for one reason alone, and that is to increase the profits of large multinational corporations. The end result of those two, just PNTR with China, Joe, and NAFTA cost us some 4 million jobs as part of the race to the bottom.",
            "I am sick and tired and will not tolerate, and we will use the power of the federal contracting system. If a corporation in America wants to shut down in Iowa or Vermont or any place else and then they think they\u00edre going to get online for a generous federal contract, they\u00edve got another thing going. We need some corporate responsibility here, and we need to protect good-paying jobs in America, not see them go to China, Mexico, Vietnam.",
            "Well, as a matter of fact, I didn\u00edt say it, and I don\u00edt want to waste a whole lot of time on this, because this is what Donald Trump and maybe some of the media want. Anybody that knows me knows that it\u00eds in comprehensible that I would think that a woman could not be President of the United States. Go to YouTube today. There\u00eds a video of me 30 years ago, talking about how a woman could become President of the United States.",
            "In 2015, I deferred, in fact, to Senate Warren. There was a movement to draft Senator Warren to run for President, and you know what? I stayed back. Senator Warren decided not to run, and I did run afterwards.",
            "Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by three million votes. How could anybody in a million years not believe that a woman could become President of the United States? Let me be very clear. If any of the women on this stage or any of the men on this stage win the nomination \u00d6 I hope that\u00eds not the case. I hope it\u00eds me. But if they do, I will do everything in my power to make sure that they are elected in order to defeat the most dangerous President in the history of our country.",
            "That is correct.",
            "Well, just to set the record straight, I defeated an incumbent Republican running for Congress.",
            "1990. That\u00eds how I won. Beat a Republican Congressman. Number two, of course \u00d6",
            "\u00d6 I don\u00edt think there\u00eds any debate on \u00d6",
            "I beat an incumbent Republican Congressman.",
            "Well, 30 years ago is 1990, as a matter of fact. But I don\u00edt know that that\u00eds the major issue of the day. I think what the major issue of the day is \u00d6 Does anybody in their right mind thing that a woman cannot be elected President? That\u00eds enough. Nobody believes that. Hillary Clinton got 3 million votes, more votes than Trump. So who believes that a woman can\u00edt win? Of course a woman can win.",
            "But the real question is how do we beat Trump? The only way we beat Trump is by a campaign of energy and excitement and a campaign that has, by far, the largest voter turnout in the history of this country.",
            "I believe that our campaign has the strongest grassroots movement.",
            "We are endorsed by many grassroots organizations.",
            "Well, what I will tell you is Medicare for All, which will guarantee comprehensive healthcare to every man, woman, and child, will cost substantially less than the status quo. Medicare for All will end the absurdity of the United States paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and healthcare in general.",
            "While we have 87 million uninsured and underinsured and while 30,000 people die each year, on the Medicare for All, one of the provisions we have to pay for it is a 4% tax on income, exempting the first $29,000. So the average family in America that today makes $60,000 would pay $1,200 a year, compared to that family paying $12,000 a year. We save money, comprehensive healthcare, because we take on the greed and the profiteering and the administrative nightmare that currently exist in our dysfunctional system.",
            "Well, first of all, what Joe forgets to say is when you leave the current system as it is, what you are talking about, all workers paying, on average, 20% of their incomes for healthcare, that is insane. You\u00edve got 500,000 people going bankrupt because they cannot pay their medical bills. We\u00edre spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country.",
            "Look. We\u00edve talked about healthcare for all in this country for over 100 years. Now is the time to take on the greed and corruption of the healthcare industry, of the drug companies, and finally provide healthcare to all through a Medicare for All single payer program. It won\u00edt be easy, but that is what we have to do.",
            "No, our plan wouldn\u00edt bankrupt the country. In fact, it would much improve the wellbeing of working class families and the middle class. Let us be clear what Medicare for all does. It ends all premiums. It ends all copayments. It ends the absurdity of deductibles. It ends out-of-pocket expenses. It takes on the pharmaceutical industry, which, in some cases, charges us ten times more for the same prescription drugs sold abroad as sold here.",
            "What we will do through a Medicare for All single payer program is substantially lower the cost of healthcare for employers and workers, because we end the hundred billion dollars a year that the healthcare industry makes and the $500 billion a year we spend an the administrative nightmare of dealing with thousands of separate insurance plans.",
            "Healthcare is a human right. Every other major country on Earth is guaranteeing healthcare for all. The time is long overdue for us to do the same.",
            "We build into our Medicare for all program a transition fund of many, many billions of dollars that will provide for up to five years income and healthcare and job training for those people. But here is the issue, Tom Steyer made the point a moment ago. We are now spending twice as much per person on healthcare as do the people of any other country. That is insane. In some cases, 10 times more for prescription drugs. Why is that? Why is that? And the answer is the greed and corruption of the drug companies and the insurance companies. And if we want to do what every other major country on Earth does and guarantee people healthcare as a human right, not a privilege, you know what we have to do? We are finally going to have to stand up to the healthcare industry-",
            "And end hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and profiteering.",
            "Yeah. Let me just pick up on this childcare thing. Every psychologist in the world knows zero through four are the most important years of human life, intellectually and emotionally, and yet our current childcare system is an embarrassment. It is unaffordable. Childcare workers are making wages lower than McDonald\u00eds workers. We need to fundamentally change priorities in America. We should not be one of the few countries that does not have universal, high quality, affordable childcare. We should not be one of the only major countries not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right. We should not be spending more than the 10 next countries on the military, hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. Tax breaks for billionaires, and then to tell the moms and dads in this country, \u00ecWe cannot have [crosstalk 01:20:36] high-quality, affordable childcare.\u00ee That is wrong.",
            "Thank you. Let\u00eds be clear, if we as a nation do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, not by 2050, not by 2040, but unless we lead the world right now, not easy stuff, the planet we are leaving our kids will be uninhabitable and unhealthy. We are seeing Australia burning. We saw California burning. The drought here in Iowa is going to make it harder for farmers to produce the food that we need. This is of course a national crisis. I\u00edve introduced legislation to indicate it\u00eds an actual crisis. We have got to take on the fossil fuel industry and all of their lies and tell them that their short term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. That\u00eds what the Green New Deal does. That\u00eds what my legislation does and that is what we have to do.",
            "Nope, not at all. And that is because the campaign that we are going to run will expose the fraudulency of who Donald Trump is. Donald Trump is corrupt. He is a pathological liar and he is a fraud. Now when Trump talks about socialism, what he talks about is giving hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. Donald Trump as a businessman, received $800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury housing. My democratic socialism says healthcare is a human right. We\u00edre going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. We\u00edre going to make public colleges and universities tuition free. We\u00edre going to have a Green New Deal and create up to $20 million, saving the planet for our children and our grandchildren. We are going to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance company. That is what democratic socialism is about and that will win this election.",
            "It\u00eds been a good debate, but we haven\u00edt asked the major question. The major question is how does it happen in the richest country in the history of the world that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck, trying to get by, $9, $10 bucks an hour? How does it happen that when the top one percent owns more wealth than the bottom 92%, half a million people are sleeping out on the streets tonight? How does it happen in this great country we are the only major nation not to guarantee healthcare to all. How does that happen that we have a child care system which is dysfunctional, a criminal justice system which is broken and racist, an immigration system that needs reform. This is the moment when we have got to think big, not small. This is the moment where we have got to have the courage to take on the one percent, take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create an economy and create a government that works for all of us, not just the one percent. Thank you."

            "I worked internationally around the world for decades. I traveled, I met with governments, I met with business, and I understand how America interacts with other countries. And you asked what is the reason that the experience really counts? And to me, I believe that Senator Warren made a great point. It isn\u00edt so much about experience, it\u00eds about judgment. If you\u00edve been listening to this, what we are hearing is 20 years of mistakes by the American government in the Middle East, of failure, of mistakes. So the real question is judgment.",
            "And if you look who had the judgment, it was a State Senator from Illinois with no experience named Barack Obama who opposed the war. It is a Congress woman, Barbara Lee from Oakland, California, who stood up against the original vote, who was the only person in Congress. So I would say to you this, an outside perspective looking at this and actually dealing with the problems as they are is what we\u00edre looking for now. I agree with Senator Warren, we are spending dramatically too much money on defense. The money that we\u00edre spending there, we could spend in the other parts of the budget and it\u00eds time for someone from the outside to have a strategic view about what we\u00edre trying to do and how to do it.",
            "I would take military action to protect the lives and safety of American citizens. But what we can see in the Middle East and what this conversation shows, is that there is no real strategy that we\u00edre trying to accomplish in what we\u00edre doing in the Middle East. Obviously Mr. Trump has no strategy. He is going from crisis to crisis from escalation to escalation. But if you look further over the last 20 years including in the war in Afghanistan, we know from the Washington Post that in fact there was no strategy, there was just a series of tactical decisions that made no sense.",
            "So we really have to ask ourselves in the Middle East, what are we trying to accomplish? I agree with Vice President Biden, to do it we should definitely be doing it in coalition with other countries. And I want to point out that as we do that we\u00edre confronted by this issue which everyone is talking about. But at the same time there\u00eds a gigantic climate issue in Australia, which also requires the same kind of value driven coalition building, that we actually should be using in the Middle East. We need to ask ourselves, how are we going to provide a world that is safer for Americans, where we can prosper more? And every single thing we do should follow into that strategy and it\u00eds just not happening in Washington DC.",
            "No. It\u00eds very clear that if we\u00edre going to do something with North Korea, we\u00edre going to have to do it in concert with our allies. That meeting with him without preconditions is not going anywhere, that the staff can meet to try and see how far we can get. But this is a classic situation where the United States idea of going it alone makes no sense. And when you are talking about Iran, let\u00eds face it, Iran is under great pressure economically. So every single discussion we\u00edve had about Iran has had to do with military power and America versus Iran. Whereas in fact what worked with President Obama was an Alliance of our allies and us, putting economic pressure on them for them to give up their military tactic. That to me is called strategy, having a goal to make America safer by looking more broadly than just us as the policemen of the world-",

I would not sign this deal, because if climate is your number one priority, you can\u00edt sign a deal, even if it\u00eds marginally better for working people, until climate is also taken into consideration.",

Everybody on this stage knows that Americans are paying twice as much for healthcare as any other advanced country in the world. It makes no sense, and the government has to step in.",
            "I do happen to agree with vice President Biden that we should move and develop the Affordable Care Act with a public option, but the real question is this. This is not a new problem. Why do we keep having this conversation? We have a broken government. It has been bought by corporations that include the drug companies, the insurance companies, and the private hospitals.",
            "That\u00eds what I\u00edm talking about. How do we get back government of, by, and for the people? How do we actually break the corporate stranglehold on our government so that we can get any of these things passed?",
            "Can I respond to this?",
            "I just want to emphasize what Senator Sanders said. This is not a complicated problem. Between what Senator Warren and Senator Sanders said, it\u00eds clear. There are two problems. We\u00edre spending way too much because corporations own the system, and we\u00edre not negotiating against those corporations and we\u00edve given tax cuts to the richest Americans and the biggest corporations for decades. That\u00eds all this is. We have corporations who are having their way with the American people and people are suffering. Senator Warren is right. This is cruelty for money. In order to break this, we\u00edre going to have to break the corporate stranglehold and solve both the tax and the negotiating problem. That\u00eds why I\u00edm for term limits. We need to redo Washington DC [crosstalk 01:12:27] and actually take back the government from the corporations who bought it.",
            "No. And let me say this, I was one of the people who talked about a wealth tax, almost a year-and-a-half ago. I believe that the income inequality in this country is unbearable, unjust and unsupportable, and the redistribution of wealth to the richest Americans from everyone else has to end. And I proposed a wealth tax almost a year-and-a-half ago to start to address it and to raise some of the money that we need. But I want to go beyond this and go back to this question about education because we\u00edre talking a lot about college.",
            "But in fact, if you talk about the Poor People\u00eds Campaign, you have to realize that for the youngest kids, they are getting an education that\u00eds relative to the taxes in their neighborhoods. We need to redistribute money so every kid has a chance. So we\u00edre not legislating inequality for the next generation. And so, we actually invest in every single kid, specifically poor kids, specifically black kids, specifically brown kids. We need to start using the money dramatically more for that.",
            "Well Wolf, actually what I\u00edve done is to organize a petition drive of eight-and-a-half million Americans to sign and say this president deserves to be impeached and removed from office. And those eight-and-a-half million people have called their Congress people, have emailed their Congress people and have actually dragged Washington DC to see that in fact, this is a question of right and wrong and not of political expediency.",
            "So, if you ask me whether standing up for what\u00eds right in America, standing up for the American people and our safety, standing up for the constitution, whether doing that and trying to bring the truth in front of the American people in televised hearings so we can decide what the truth is for ourselves, if you think that that isn\u00edt worth it, then you don\u00edt share the idea that I do about what America\u00eds about. Standing up for what\u00eds right is always worth it, Wolf, and I will never back down from that.",

And of course, we\u00edre going to come to the rescue of Americans who are in trouble. But this is why climate is my number one priority. And I\u00edm still shocked that I\u00edm the only person on this stage who will say this. I would declare a state of emergency on day one on climate. I would do it from the standpoint of environmental justice and make sure we go to the black and brown communities where you can\u00edt breathe the air or drink the water that comes out of the tap safely.

Look, we invested in every part of the economy and over 10 years ago I realized that there was something going on that had to do with fossil fuels, that we had to change. So I divested from fossil fuels. I took the giving pledge to give most of my money away while I\u00edm alive. And for 12 years, I\u00edve been fighting the climate crisis. I\u00edve beat oil companies in terms of clean air laws. I\u00edve stopped fossil fuel plants in Oxnard, California. I fought the Keystone Pipeline. I have a history of over a decade of leading the climate fight successfully-",

So let\u00eds be clear, I started a business by myself in one room. I didn\u00edt inherit a penny from my parents. I spent 30 years building that business into a multi-billion dollar international business. Then I walked away from it and took the giving pledge and started organizing coalitions of ordinary Americans to take on unchecked corporate power. But whoever is going to beat Mr. Trump is going to have to beat him on the economy and I have the experience and the expertise to show that he\u00eds a [inaudible 01:50:58] and a fraud. Look, Mayor Pete has three years as an analyst at McKinsey. I have 30 years of international business experience, I can beat Trump on the economy.

But I am asking for your support because I know that if I\u00edm going to be a good teammate to you and give you absolutely everything without any compromise, I need the support of you on caucus night so I can turn around and together we can take back this country and together we can save the world."

            "And then what happens? It\u00eds all the same for another year. Someone new comes in and we\u00edve just turned the corner. We\u00edve turned the corners so many times we\u00edre going in circles in these regions. This has got to stop. It\u00eds not enough to say, \u00ecSomeday we\u00edre going to get out.\u00ee No one on the ground. None of our military can describe what the conditions are for getting out. It\u00eds time to get our combat troops home.",
            "I do. I wasn\u00edt here, I haven\u00edt been in Congress long enough to have voted against NAFTA, but I led the fight against the trade deal with Asia and the trade deal with Europe because I didn\u00edt think it was in the interest of the American people, the American workers or environmental interests. But we have farmers here in Iowa who are hurting and they are hurting because of Donald Trump\u00eds initiated trade wars. We have workers who are hurting because the agreements that have already been cut, really don\u00edt have enforcement on workers rights.",
            "This new trade deal is a modest improvement, Senator Sanders himself has said so. It will give some relief to our farmers, it will give some relief to our workers. I believe we accept that relief, we try to help the people who need help and we get up the next day and fight for a better trade deal. We need a coherent trade policy. We need a policy that actually helps our workers, our farmers. We need them at the table, not just a trade policy written for big international companies. I\u00edm ready to have that fight but let\u00eds help the people who need help right now.",
            "Our problem is not just that we need corporate responsibility. It\u00eds been the structure of how these trade deals have been negotiated. The United States has had a strategy for decades, and that strategy has been to have government trade negotiators, a small number, and then surround them with giant multinational corporation lobbyists and corporate executives who whisper in the ears of our negotiators and then get deals cut that are great for the giant multinational corporations, not good for America, not good for American workers, not good for the environment.",
            "We need a different approach to trade, and it starts by calling out the corruption of these giant corporations that have cut our trade deals. Everybody wants to get to the American market, and we need to put some standards in place. You want to be able to sell your goods here, then you\u00edve got to meet some environmental standards. You\u00edve got to meet labor standards.",
            "We need a coherent approach.",
            "I disagreed. Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie. But look. This question about whether or not a woman can be President has been raised, and it\u00eds time for us to attack it head-on. I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people\u00eds winning record.",
            "So can a woman beat Donald Trump? Look at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost ten elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they\u00edve been in are the women. The only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican anytime in the past 30 years is me, and here\u00eds what I know. The real danger that we face as Democrats is picking a candidate who can\u00edt pull our party together or someone who takes for granted big parts of the Democratic constituency.",
            "We need a candidate who will excite all parts of the Democratic Party, bring everyone in, and give everyone a Democrat to believe in. That\u00eds my plan, and that is why I\u00edm going to win.",
            "When?",
            "30 years ago.",
            "Wasn\u00edt that 30 years ago?",
            "I said I was the only one who has beaten an incumbent Republican in 30 years.",
            "So I do think it\u00eds the right question, how do we beat Trump? Here\u00eds the thing. Since Donald Trump was elected, women candidates have outperformed men candidates in competitive races. In 2018, we took back the House. We took back state houses because of women candidates and women voters.",
            "Look. Don\u00edt deny that the question is there. Back in the 1960s, people asked, \u00ecCould a Catholic win?\u00ee Back in 2008, people asked if an African American could win. Both times, the Democratic Party stepped up and said yes, got behind their candidate, and we changed America. That\u00eds who we are.",
            "So we need to start with what\u00eds happening in America. People are suffering. I\u00edll just pick one. 36 million people last year went to the doctor, got a prescription. This is what they needed to get well, and they couldn\u00edt afford to have the prescription filled. They looked at it and said, \u00ecIt\u00eds either groceries or this prescription.\u00ee",
            "My approach to this is we\u00edve got to get as much help to as many people as quickly as possible. I have worked out a plan where we can do that without raising taxes on middle class families by one thin dime.",
            "What I can do are the things that I can do as President on the first day. We can cut the cost of prescription drugs. I\u00edll use the power that\u00eds already given to the President to reduce the cost of insulin and EpiPens and HIV/AIDS drugs. Let\u00eds get some relief to those families, and I will defend the Affordable Care Act.",
            "I\u00edve got a plan to expand healthcare. But let\u00eds keep in mind, when we come to a general election, we Democrats may argue among each other about the best way to do healthcare, but we\u00edre going to be up against a Republican incumbent who has cut healthcare for millions of people and is still trying to do that. I\u00edll take our side of the argument any day. We\u00edre going to beat him on this.",
            "So I started this by talking about 36 million Americans including Americans with insurance who just can\u00edt even afford to have a prescription filled. We all talk about plans, healthcare plans that we have, and these plans are paid for. The problem is that plans like the mayor\u00eds and like the vice president\u00eds is that they are an improvement. They are an improvement over where we are right now. Not going to be enough to cover prescriptions for 36 million people who can\u00edt afford to get them filled. What we need to do is make the commitment that we know where the money comes from. We can ask those at the very top, the top 1% to pay a little more. Those giant corporations like Chevron and Amazon who paid nothing in taxes. We can have them pay, and we can go after the corporate tax cheats. And when we do that, we have enough money to provide healthcare for all our people.",
            "Tax cheats. And when we do that, we have enough money to provide healthcare for all our people. Yes, we build on the Affordable Care Act, but where we end up is we offer healthcare to all of our people, and we can offer it at no cost or low cost to all of them.",
            "Look, the numbers that the mayor\u00eds offering just don\u00edt add up. The average family in America last year paid $12,000 in some combination of deductibles and copays, and uncovered expenses and fees. You can\u00edt cover that with the kind of money that the mayor is talking about. The way we have to approach this is we\u00edve got to build this and we\u00edve got to build the alliances to make this happen. I can bring down the cost of prescription drugs like insulin and take hundreds of millions of dollars out of the system immediately in costs. We can get help to families, but we have to be willing to work together.",
            "We can let people experience what healthcare is like when it\u00eds you and your doctor, your mental health professional, your nurse practitioner with no insurance companies standing in the middle. [crosstalk 01:09:12] When people try it and use it, then.",
            "So, let\u00eds do this both ways. What I also have said is I\u00edm just going to use the power that is available, and I will do what a president can do all by herself on the very first day, and that is lower the prices of certain prescription drugs. I will lower the price of insulin. We already have the legal authority with the president to do that. President just hasn\u00edt picked up and used it. I will lower the price of EpiPens, of HIV/AIDS drugs. That\u00eds going to bring a lot of relief to a lot of families immediately, but you know there are a whole lot of drugs, about 90% of drugs that are not under patent. They\u00edre generic drugs, but the drug industry has figured out how to manipulate this industry to keep jerking the prices up and up and up. So my view is let\u00eds give them a little competition.",
            "The government lets contracts for all kinds of things. They let contracts to build buildings, they let contracts to build military weapons. Let\u00eds let the contracts out, put the contracts out so that we can put more generic drugs out there and drive down those prices. This is a way to make markets work, not to try to move away from the market. You don\u00edt have to even use price controls. The whole idea behind it is get some competition out there so the price of these drugs that are no longer under patent drops where it should be.",
            "No, actually my plan is universal childcare for everyone. It just has some people adding a small payment, but understand this about the plan. I\u00edve been there. You know, I remember when I was a young mom, I had two little kids and I had my first real university teaching job. It was hard work. I was excited, but it was childcare that nearly brought me down. We went through one childcare after another and it just didn\u00edt work.",
            "If I hadn\u00edt been saved by my Aunt Bee, I was ready to quit my job. And I think about how many women of my generation just got knocked off the track and never got back on. How many of my daughter\u00eds generation get knocked off the track and don\u00edt get back on. How many mamas and daddies today are getting knocked off the track and never get back on.",
            "I have a two-cent wealth tax so that we can cover childcare for all of our children and provide universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old in America, and stop exploiting the people who do this valuable work, largely black and brown women. We can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America. That\u00eds an investment in our babies. That\u00eds an investment in their mamas and their daddies and it\u00eds an investment in our teachers and in our economy.",
            "It\u00eds what we need to do.",
            "So look, the way I think we need to do this is we need a wealth tax in America. We need to ask people with fortunes above $50 million to pay more, and that means that the lowliest millionaire that I would tax under this wealth tax would be paying about $19 million in the first year in taxes. If he wants to send his kid to public university, then I\u00edm okay with that because what we really need to talk about is the bigger economic picture here. We need to be willing to put a wealth tax in place to ask those giant corporations that are not paying to pay because that\u00eds how we build an economy and for those who want to talk about it, bring down the national debt. You do universal child care, and you got a lot of mamas who can go to work. A lot of mamas who can finish their education. We make that investment in universal college. We\u00edve got [crosstalk 01:24:44] people who would finish an education.",
            "Look, some things are more important than politics. I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America. It says that no one is above the law that includes the president of the United States. If we have an impeachment trial, I will be there because it is my responsibility. But understand this, what that impeachment trial is going to show once again to the American people, and something we should all be talking about, is the corruption of this administration. That\u00eds what lies at the heart of it. It is about Donald Trump putting Donald Trump first, not the American people, not the interests of the United States of America, not even in helping Ukraine defend against Russia. It is about him helping himself. That is what we need to do to win this election. We need to draw that distinction and show that as Democrats, we\u00edre not going to be the people who are just out for the big corporations, people who want to help themselves, that we are going to be the party that is willing to fight on the side of the people. That\u00eds why we\u00edre here.",
            "Yes. Climate change threatens every living thing on this planet and the urgency of the moment cannot be overstated. I will do everything a president can do all by herself on the first day. I will roll back the environmental changes that Donald Trump is putting in place. I will stop all new drilling and mining on federal lands and offshore drilling. That\u00edll help us get in the right directions. I\u00edll bring in the farmers. Farmers can be part of the climate solution. We should see this though for the problem it is. Mr. Steyer talks about it being problem number one. Understand this, we have known about this climate crisis for decades. Back in the 1990s, we were calling it global warming, but we knew what it was. Democrats and Republicans back then were working together because no one wanted a problem.",
            "But you know what happened? The industry came in and said, we can make big money if we keep them divided and make no change. Priority number one has to be taking back our government from the corruption. That is the only way we will make progress on climate, on gun safety, on healthcare, on all of the issues-",
            "That matter to us.",
            "So I was born and raised in Oklahoma. I have three older brothers who are all retired, who are all back there still. And two of my three brothers are Republicans. And sure, there are a lot of things we disagree on and we can take to our corners and do the Democratic, Republican talking points. But the truth is there\u00eds a whole lot we agree on. You know, my brothers just furious over Chevron and Eli Lilly and Amazon, that are giant corporations make billions of dollars in taxes \u00d6 make billions of dollars in profits and pay nothing in taxes. My brother said, \u00ecI don\u00edt get this. I have to pay my taxes. Somebody has to keep the roads paved and the schools open and pay for our defense.\u00ee",
            "They understand that we have an America right now that\u00eds working great for those at the top. It\u00eds just not working for anyone else. We have a chance to unite, unite as Democrats, but also with independents and Republicans, who are sick of living in a country that\u00eds working great for the politicians that are taking the money. It\u00eds working great for the lobbyists. It\u00eds working great for the corporate executives. It\u00eds just not working for everyone else. I\u00edm building the grassroots movement, leading the fight. We\u00edre going to make this America work for everyone else. That is how we\u00edre going to beat Donald Trump.",
            "So, much is broken in this country. I sat here in the break and just made notes about many of the things we didn\u00edt get to talk about tonight. How the disability community is struggling for true equality, how gun violence and active shooter drills worry every mother in this country. How children are living in poverty and seeing their life chances shrink. How trans women, particularly trans women of color are at risk. Black infant mortality, climate change that particularly hits black and brown communities. People who are being crushed by student loan debt, farmers who are barely holding on, people struggling with mental illness. And yet I come here tonight with a heart filled with hope and it\u00eds filled with hope because I see this as our moment in history, our moment when no one is left on the sidelines. Our moment when we understand that it comes to us to decide the future of this country. Our moment when we build the movement to make real change, hope and courage. That is how I will make you proud every day as your nominee and as the first woman president of the United States of America."

            "Well, you know that with regard to Senator Sanders, the President wants very much to sic a label on every candidate. We\u00edre going to not only have to win this time, we have to bring along the United States Senate. And Bernie\u00eds labeled himself, not me, a democratic socialist. I think that\u00eds the label that the President\u00eds going to lay on everyone running with Bernie if he\u00eds a nominee. And a Mayor Buttigieg is a great guy and a real patriot. He\u00eds a mayor of a small city, who has done some good things but has not demonstrated he has the ability to, and we\u00edll soon find out, to get a broad scope of support across the spectrum, including African Americans and Latinos.",
            "Look, Bernie says that you have to bring people together and we have to have Medicare for All. But Bernie says, and he says he wrote the damn thing, but he\u00eds unwilling to sell us with the damn thing\u00eds going to cost. The fact that we\u00edre in New Hampshire, very levelheaded group of people, look at the numbers. How much is it going to cost? Who\u00eds going to pay for it? It will cost more than the entire, the entire federal budget we spend now, more than entire budget. The idea middle class taxes aren\u00edt going to go up is just crazy. When they did it in Vermont, what happened? They doubled the state income tax and then had a 14% tax on withholding. And they finally did away with it. So how much is it going to cost? When you ask Bernie that, and I\u00edll ask him again tonight sometime, and if you ask Bernie that, he says, \u00ecGo figure, I don\u00edt know, we\u00edll find out.\u00ee",
            "I think that was on CBS. He said, \u00ee We\u00edll find out.\u00ee Or something to that effect. Imagine you\u00edre going to unite the country walking into the Congress, \u00ecI got this bill. It\u00eds going to require Medicare for everybody. I can\u00edt tell you how much it\u00eds going to cost. We\u00edll find out later and it\u00eds likely to be double whatever \u00d6 everything we spent in the federal government.\u00ee Who do you think is going to get that passed? I busted my neck getting Obamacare passed, getting every Democratic vote. I know how hard it is.",

You have Medicare if you want it, you turn [inaudible 00:16:16] we\u00edre going to restore all the cuts that they made in Obamacare. We\u00edre going to reduce drug prices, reduce prescription prices, reduce copays, et cetera. And it cost a lot of money, it costs $750 billion over 10 years. I tell you how I\u00edm going to pay for it. I\u00edm going to raise the capital gains rates, you pay capital gains and what your tax rate is. That\u00edll pay for it, that\u00eds $800 billion. But here\u00eds the deal, the fact is that it\u00eds going to cost \u00d6 Bernie\u00eds plan costs double, double what the taxpayers are paying for every single program we spend on in the United States of America.",
            "The politics of the past I think were not all that bad. I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. I managed the $900 billion Recovery Act, which in fact put millions and millions of dollars into his city before he came and helped save his city. I was able to do it, I was able to pass the chemical weapons ban, arms control. And I was the first major leader holding public office to call for same sex marriage. So I don\u00edt know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden was so bad. What happened? What is it that he wants to do away with? We were just beginning.",
            "\u00d6 Happened, what is it that he wants to do away with? We were just beginning. It was just the beginning of what will be the future of moving this country beyond where it is now in significant ways, and there\u00eds ways to do that, and one of the ways to do that is to make sure you have someone who knows how to get things done, and can lead the free world at the same time.",
            "I thank my colleague for saying that. It is a diversion, but here\u00eds the deal. Whomever the nominee is, the president\u00eds going to make up lies about. He thinks he has free reign right now. One of the things that I think is really important is we have to be authentic with the American people about what we\u00edre going to do and how we\u00edre going to do it. And by the way, Colonel Vindman got thrown out of the White House, walked out. I think at the same time, he should have been pinning a medal on Vindman, and not on rush Limbaugh. And I think we should all stand and give Colonel Vindman a show of how much we supported him. Stand up and clap for Vindman. Get up there. Who we are. That\u00eds who we are. We are not what Trump is.",
            "No. And the reason I wouldn\u00edt have ordered the strike, there is no evidence yet of imminent threat that was going to come from him.

We are alone now, alone in that region of the world, without friends, without support, without allies.",

They defeated ISIS. They ended the caliphate and then the president on a whim dealing with a man I know very well, they\u00edve now, the guy running Turkey who is more of an autocrat now than a Democrat, and what happened?

            "And with regard Afghanistan, now I can say it because it was made public, I was totally against the whole notion of no nation building in Afghanistan. The only thing we should be doing is dealing with terrorism in that region. I\u00edve been in every part of Afghanistan, not in combat like my friend has, but in helicopter and/or on a vehicle in every part of it as senator and vice president. Here\u00eds what I saw, there is no possibility of uniting that country, no possibility at all of making it a whole country. But it is possible to see to it that they\u00edre not able to launch more attacks from the region on the United States of America. That\u00eds a small footprint that we needed and I argued for that in the beginning.",
            "I made a mistake and I said it 14 years ago. I trusted George Bush to keep his word. He said he was not going to go into Iraq. He said he was only using this to unite the United Nations to insist we get inspectors in to see what Saddam was doing.

We need NATO for more reasons than just physical security. We need NATO to make sure that we do not allow Russia to continue to have its influence in Eastern Europe in ways that it had before. It wasn\u00edt just to stop the Soviet Union from coming into the United States, coming into Europe. It was to make sure that we did not have a kleptocracy taking over that part of the world, to unite Europe in our behalf. I know how to deal with them. I know every one of these world leaders by their first names. They call me. I talked to them and I believe I can get it done.",

I\u00edve been part of every major initiative we\u00edve had relative to diplomacy. I have not argued for the placement of major numbers of US combat troops. I have said, along with the President of the United States, Barack Obama as his partner, I have said, we have to strengthen NATO to make it clear that we keep our commitments when we make them.

And it has to be done jointly by a whole lot of people and it doesn\u00edt require large number of US troops, and I\u00edve never said that.",
            "Here\u00eds the deal. The biggest mistake that Bernie made, that Senator Sanders made, he voted to give the gun manufacturers, the only major industry in America, a loophole that does not allow them to be sued for the carnage they are creating. First thing I\u00edll do as President is work to get rid of that. It\u00eds going to be hard. Think of all the thousands and thousands of people who died. And I might add Bernie, while you were representing your constituency, an awful lot of people [inaudible 00:13:18] your gun state and they\u00edve come around. In fact, all those folks in California, New York, Pennsylvania, they\u00edre getting killed by the thousands during the same period.",

While I was pushing the Brady Background Bill to check background checks, Bernie voted five times against that when he was in the House. So look, the other thing is that we have to be held accountable for the things we did, I\u00edm the guy that set up drug courts. I set them up. I wrote it into law and it never got funded. And also on opioids, I\u00edm the guy who\u00eds already begun to make a down payment. In the Cures Act I put in $1 billion to fight opioid addiction. And lastly, my time is going to be up, surely. Here\u00eds the deal. Those Chief Executive Officer of drug companies, they should not only be fined, they should go to jail.",

            "If you say the rest of what I said. I said that we\u00edre going to not appoint anyone who did not have a view that unenumerated rights existed in the Constitution. That\u00eds not a specific test. It\u00eds a generic test. And only way, the only reason women have the right to choose is because it\u00eds determined that there\u00eds unenumerated rights coming from the Ninth Amendment in the Constitution. That\u00eds what I said. And I was part of the reason why Elena Kagan, who worked for me, we got onto the Supreme Court. I was part of the reason why Ruth Bader Ginsburg is on the Court. I was part of the reason why Sotomayer is on the Court and she will swear me in. I presided, and I\u00edm the reason why this right wasn\u00edt taken away a long time ago because I almost single handedly made sure that Robert Bork did not get on the Court because he did not think there should be enumerated rights [inaudible 00:18:04].",
            "Let\u00eds get that straight.",
            "Yes. Look, here\u00eds the deal. Litmus test on abortion relates to the fundamental value of the Constitution. A woman does have a right to choose. I would in fact, if they rule it to be unconstitutional, I will send to the United States Congress and it will pass, I believe, a bill that\u00d6 Excuse me, legislates Roe V. Wade adjusted by Casey. It\u00eds a woman\u00eds right to do that. Period. And if you call that a litmus test it\u00eds a litmus test, but what I was talking about in the past, so no one gets confused here, is if there is no\u00d6 If you read the Constitution very, very narrowly and say there are no unenumerated rights. If the doesn\u00edt say it in the Constitution that doesn\u00edt exist, you cannot have any of the things I care about, any of the things I care about as a progressive member of the United States Congress at the time, and as Vice President and as a member of society.",
            "I agree with Ruth Bader Ginsburg. That\u00eds who I agree with. And I agree the way you deal with Citizens United is pass a constitutional amendment I introduced 25 years ago saying that only public money can be spent in elections. Period. Not private money, not billionaires, not money from special interests. Period. That\u00eds the way to amend the Constitution to deal with that. In addition to that, if in fact\u00d6 Look, the Democrats stood up against the man I\u00edve revered, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he wanted to expand the Court. But they were wise enough to understand that whoever then has the majority will have the ability to abuse it and it will lose its legitimacy and there are three equal branches of government. It says the President shell nominate, the Senate shall dispose, the Senate shall make that decision, not the president. He can nominate.",
            "That\u00eds why it\u00eds so important we must win back the United States Senate this time out. And that\u00eds why as you all look at it up here in New Hampshire and around the world, excuse me, around the country, you have to ask yourself, who is most likely to help get a Senator elected in North Carolina, Georgia? Who can win Florida, Pennsylvania, Minnesota? Who can do that? Because you got to be able to win those\u00d6 Well, you can. I agree. But here\u00eds the point.

We\u00edve got to stop taking the black community for granted. That\u00eds the starting place. Every one of the things we talked about here, for example, in South Carolina, Jim Clyburn, he has a program, 10-15-30. We should be investing our money in those communities that haven\u00edt gotten help for a long time and give most of that help to those communities. Make it a priority. We should make sure that we have no one going to jail for a drug offense, they go directly, mandatory prison. I mean, excuse me, mandatory treatment, not prison. And we fund it. And we fund it, and three days doesn\u00edt get it. It takes at least 60 to 90 days to make any progress. We have to pay for that.",

We have to make sure that we have a window at the Treasury Department that allows entrepreneurs who are black and brown and minorities to be able to get loans to be able to start businesses. You know, if you own a house, I know you do know, if you own a house in an all black neighborhood, same exact house in all white neighborhood, exact same shape, the house valued in the black neighborhood would be valued as worth less, making it difficult for you to accumulate wealth, as my friend at the end of the line here says. So here\u00eds the deal: we have to do much, much more. That\u00eds what got me involved in politics in the first place, redlining, to stop it.",
            "I got involved through the Civil Rights Movement, I became a public defender. That\u00eds why I got involved. There\u00eds so many things we have to do across the board, and in education, at-risk schools. We should triple the funding we have for at-risk schools to provide for three, four, and five years old to go to school, not daycare. Increase the salaries of teachers, encourage more blacks to get into teaching, especially black men, because studies show when there\u00eds a black man in a school, it increases prospects significantly, and so on. There\u00eds a lot we can do, I\u00edve laid it all out as how to do, go to joebiden.com, you\u00edll see the whole deal, including criminal justice reform.",

I watched my dad and I met many people here in this state and others, who go through the same thing where the father\u00eds made that longest walk or the mother\u00eds made that longest walk. I was listed for the entire time I was in the United States Congress as the poorest man in the United States Congress. My net worth was net zero a couple of times. The fact of the matter is that I\u00edve never focused on money for me and I was a single dad for five years. It\u00eds not as hard as being a single mom and I had help from my sisters in the audience and others, but the fact is that I think we have to focus on what is at stake here.",

            "Many of them come from homes that are poor, very poor. That\u00eds why I invest so much time and energy in preschool. That\u00eds why if I only have $1 to spend, I spend it equipping the child before they get into school in the early day, than after and we talk about all those kids out there that are going to be graduating. A great number of them, as Mr. Yang said, aren\u00edt going on to college, although I think we should help with college. They\u00edre not going on to college. What they\u00edre going to do, they\u00edre going to be equipped to compete in the 21st century by training them for the new trades, the new opportunities, the new capabilities that are out there. We must focus on our children. Like I said, they\u00edre all our children, they\u00edre not somebody else\u00eds kids.

            "I\u00edm not interested in the labels. I\u00edm not interested in what Republicans are going to say. I\u00edm interested in the style of politics that we need to put forward to actually, finally turn the page. In order to win, yes, but also in order to govern. This is a moment where the next president is going to face challenges the likes of which we hadn\u00edt even thought of a few years or decades ago. And politically, we\u00edre facing a fundamentally new problem with President Donald Trump. So the biggest risk we could take at a time like this would be to go up against that fundamentally new challenge by trying to fall back on the familiar. Or trying to unite this country at a moment when we need that kind of unification, when our nominee is dividing people with a politics that says, if you don\u00edt go all the way to the edge, it doesn\u00edt count. A politics that says, it\u00eds my way or the highway.",
            "Yes. Because we\u00edve got to bring as many people as we can into this process. Look, all of us have been saying that we can build the majority that it\u00eds going to take in order to win. But the process of actually proving it is now underway. And now it comes to New Hampshire, a state that thinks for itself, is not going to be told what to do by anyone and that has a very independent streak that is going to respond to those who are reaching out in a politics of addition and inclusion and belonging. Not one that beats people over the head and says they shouldn\u00edt even be on their side if we don\u00edt agree 100% of the time.",
            "I think there\u00eds a better way. It\u00eds true, the American people are ready. There\u00eds a historic majority right now, even broader than what was available to President Obama a decade ago. There is now a majority ready to act to make sure there is no such thing as an uninsured American and no such thing as an unaffordable prescription. Just so long as we don\u00edt command people to accept a public plan if they don\u00edt want to. That\u00eds the idea of Medicare for All Who Want It. My point is, what I am offering is campaigning for all of these things that America wants. Yes, higher wages, doubling the rate of unionization in this country, making corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share, delivering healthcare and college affordability. But also offering a way to do these game changing transformations that will actually galvanize and energize, not polarize the American people. That is not only what we need in order to win, it\u00eds what we need in order to govern and actually get these things done.",
            "Sure. Well, first of all, just to be clear, the truth is that I have been consistent throughout in my position on delivering healthcare for every American. And as to experience, I just bring a different perspective. Look, I freely admit that if you\u00edre looking for the person with the most years of Washington establishment experience under their belt, you\u00edve got your candidate, and of course it\u00eds not me. The perspective I\u00edm bringing is that of somebody whose life has been shaped by the decisions that are made in those big white buildings in Washington, D.C. Somebody who has guided a community written off as dying just a decade ago through historic transformation. Somebody who knows what it means to be sent to war on orders that come out of the Situation Room. We need a perspective right now that will finally allow us to leave the politics of the past in the past. Turn the page and bring change to Washington before it\u00eds too late.",
            "Those achievements were phenomenally important, because they met the moment, but now we have to meet this moment. And this moment is different. The next president is going to face challenges from global health security, like what we\u00edre seeing coming out of China, to cybersecurity, and election security challenges that were barely thought of a few years ago. And here at home, we\u00edre seeing things like gig work, transform what it means to be a worker in America, in ways that were barely conceived of not that long ago. We cannot solve the problems before us by looking back. We have to be ready to turn the page, and change our politics before it\u00eds too late. And I\u00edm seeing everywhere I go, not just fellow Democrats, but a striking number of independents, and, what I like to call future former Republicans ready to join in that historic American majority to turn the page.",
            "Here\u00eds how we\u00edre going to win. We\u00edre going to force this president to stand on that debate stage, next to somebody who actually lives in a middle class neighborhood, in the industrial Midwest, in the exact kind of community that he pretends to speak for, but turns his back on. We\u00edre going to put up somebody who\u00eds not afraid to call out things like his disgraceful behavior at the national prayer breakfast, and remind Americans that God does not belong to a political party. We\u00edre going to win by having somebody up there who can call him to account for his refusal to serve when it was his turn, and remind him what serving this country is really about. If we want to beat this president, we\u00edve got to be ready to move on from the playbook that we have relied on in the past, and unify this country around a new and better vision. That\u00eds how we\u00edre going to win. And when I talk about exhaustion, this is important, because I got to tell you, the American people, from outside of Washington, we feel a sense of exhaustion watching the division, and the dysfunction there.",
            "And that is not to take anything away from the very good work that you and our other democratic members of Congress, and the Senate are doing. It\u00eds not. But, the reason I raise that sense of exhaustion is I see it. I see that temptation to walk away from it all among so many people that I\u00edve spoken to in communities from Claremont to Manchester, and in the other states that we\u00edre in. And the important thing for the American people to remember, is this is 2020, it\u00eds an election year. And if the Senate was the jury before, you are the jury now. The American people are the jury that will have the final verdict on this president, and on the senators in the GOP who protected him.",

            "No, and we\u00edre not going to let them change the subject. This is not about Hunter Biden, or vice president Biden, or any Biden. This is about an abuse of power by the president. The vice president and I and all of us are competing. But we\u00edve got to draw a line here. And to be the kind of president, to be the kind of human being who would seek to turn someone against his own son, who would seek to weaponize a son against his own father, is an unbelievably dishonorable thing, that is just one more example of why we as a party have to be completely united in doing whatever it takes at the end of the day to make sure that this president does not get a second term.",
            "In the situation that we saw with President Trump\u00eds decision, there is no evidence that that made our country safer. Look, I feel very strongly about the campaign of murder and mayhem that General Soleimani and his units have perpetrated. It\u00eds also the case that if we learned nothing else from the war in Iraq, it\u00eds that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea if you do not know what you were doing. This president has moved us this much closer to the brink of war, but it didn\u00edt start with the Soleimani strike. It started with withdrawing us from the Iran nuclear deal that his own administration certified was working. And it\u00eds time for us to recognize that every time a step is taken that moves us to the brink of war, that has incredibly serious consequences for those who serve.",
            "By chance, just because I was traveling for the campaign, not long ago, I ran into somebody that I hadn\u00edt seen since we were both serving, hadn\u00edt seen since she was injured in an insider attack. And I saw her coming down the concourse in the airport wearing a Wounded Warrior Project tee shirt that said, \u00ecSome assembly required.\u00ee And when I asked her how she was doing, she up her knee and tapped on the part of her leg that they couldn\u00edt save, tapped on the prosthetic and said the Navy had fixed her up just fine and then let me know that she was looking forward to an upcoming deployment.",
            "The people in our uniform will do whatever the United States requires of them. What they deserve in return is a president who will actually read the intelligence, pay attention to the international security situation, consult with our allies, keep US politics out of it, and never commit our troops to a situation where they would have to go into harm\u00eds way if there is an alternative.",
            "It depends on the circumstances. It depends if there was an alternative and it depends what the different effects would be. That\u00eds my point. This is not an episode of 24. This is a situation that requires that you actually evaluate the entire intelligence picture. This president has insulted the intelligence community, but they put their lives on the line to gather the information that will help a decision maker evaluate whether or not something like that is justified. And I don\u00edt think he even reads it.",
            "And here we have a situation where the world, that one of the most volatile places in the world has just become more dangerous at the hands of a president who has no regard for the military, not only punishing a war hero today with what he did to Colonel Vindman, but pardoning war criminals in a way that undermines the entire sense of good order and discipline and military honor. We deserve a better commander-in-chief.",
            "I believe that I have the judgment to help us get through these situations where obviously the vice president made the wrong decision when it came to such an important moment in our foreign policy. And looking forward, we got to recognize just how much is going to be on the plate of the next president that is different in kind from what we have faced before. It\u00eds not just about dealing with the aftermath of the war in Iraq, it\u00eds about preventing a war with Iran. And not only do we have to undertake the military and counter terrorism activities that we\u00edve been doing throughout, the next president is going to have to restore the credibility of this country among our allies and among the international community.",
            "At a moment when we are facing fundamentally different challenges from asymmetric warfare to cybersecurity threats, in President Trump\u00eds imagination of a national security strategy is a big wall and a moat full of alligators. It\u00eds a 17th century approach to keeping a place safe. What we have to do is be ready for the future and that means insisting not only on shoring up our relationships, but defining a strategy to keep the American people safe from fundamentally new challenges.",
            "No. What I\u00edve called for is that incarceration should no longer be the response to drug possession.",
            "Again, what I\u00edm calling for is that we end the use of incarceration as a response. This does not mean that it will be lawful to produce or distribute those kinds of harmful drugs, but also as we know from the opioid crisis, some of this has been driven by companies that were acting irresponsibly with substances that were lawful. It\u00eds why in South Bend we sued those companies to hold them accountable. We\u00edve got to make sure that there is accountability for those who suppressed evidence about the addictiveness of those substances. Even while we\u00edre also coming to recognize that these kinds of addiction are a medical issue, not a moral failure on the part of somebody battling that addiction.",
            "That\u00eds why medication assisted treatment is so important. And those people who are being revived, and our own EMTs in my city had been so frustrated by the experience of reviving somebody, but then they have nowhere to go. Sometimes you get brought back with a dose of Narcan, but then your life depends on whether in the days that follow you make it until somebody can actually see you, because we have such a shortage of mental health and addiction providers in this country. We must act to change that and save lives when we do.",
            "Well, if all we did was change the number of justices than I agree with her that that could be the consequence. What I\u00edve called for is not only reforming the number of justices on the bench, but structural reform so that some of the justices are not appointed through a partisan process. We cannot allow the Supreme Court to continue to become one more political battlefield as we are seeing today. And the time has come for us to think bigger, not just reforming the makeup of the court as America, by the way, has done several times in our history. But also remember that the founders gave us the power to amend the Constitution for a reason and we shouldn\u00edt be afraid to use it.",
            "It\u00eds not something you do lightly or quickly, but when it comes to something like Citizens United, which holds that corporations have the same political soul as people and that spending money to influence an election is the same thing as writing an op-ed to your local paper, we need a Constitutional amendment to clear that up and protect our democracy.",
            "Well, the reality is, on my watch, drug arrests in South Bend were lower than the national average, and specifically to marijuana, lower than in Indiana. But there is no question that systemic racism has penetrated to every level of our system, and my city was not immune. I took a lot of heat for discussing systemic racism with my own police department, but we\u00edve got to confront the fact that there is no escaping how this is part of all of our policies.",
            "Earlier, we were talking about opioids, and thankfully, America has come to a better understanding about the fact that opioid addiction is best understood as a medical problem. But there were a lot of people, including a lot of African American activists in my community who have made the very good point, it\u00eds great that everybody\u00eds so enlightened about drug policy now when it comes to opioids, but where were you when it came to marijuana, where were you when it came to the crack epidemic in the 1990s? That is one of the reasons why I am calling for us as a country to take up those reforms that end incarceration as a response to possession and make sure that we legalize marijuana and when we do it, do it retroactively with expungements to correct the harm done in so many cases of incarceration, disproportionately of black and brown Americans where the incarceration did far more harm than the offense it was intended to deal with.",
            "And again, the overall rate was lower than the national rate.",
            "And one of the strategies that our community adopted was to target, when there were cases where there was gun violence and gang violence, which was slaughtering so many in our community, burying teenagers, disproportionately black teenagers, we adopted a strategy that said that drug enforcement would be targeted in cases where there was a connection to the most violent group or gang connected to a murder.",
            "These things are all connected, but that\u00eds the point. So are all of the things that need to change in order for us to prevent violence and remove the effects of systemic racism, not just from criminal justice, but from our economy, from health, from housing, and from our democracy itself.",
            "We are going into the fight of our lives. Donald Trump, according to news reports, and his allies raised $25 million today. We need to go into that fight with everything that we\u00edve got. Now I\u00edve been very clear on both my record, where I have sued pharmaceutical companies, and what I\u00edm campaigning for, that includes raising wages and raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. And as the only person on this stage who is not a millionaire or a billionaire, I know a thing or two about building a movement because mayor of South Bend, Indiana is not exactly an establishment fundraising powerhouse.",
            "We are here without the involvement of any corporate PACs because hundreds of thousands of people went to, yes, peteforamerica.com, contributed to this campaign, and let me say something else. If we want to bring about any of the changes that everyone is talking about so elegantly up here, we need to put together the majority that can decisively defeat Donald Trump. And in order to do that, we need a politics that is defined not by who we reject, but how we bring everybody into the fold. And if you are low-income, or if you\u00edre able to contribute a lot. If you\u00edve always voted Democrat, or if you\u00edre an Independent or even a Republican who\u00eds just sick of looking your kids in the eye and trying to explain this White House, we need you to join us right now. I will not pursue politics by telling people they can\u00edt be at our side if they\u00edre not with us 100% of the time. This is a time for addition, not rejection, for belonging, not exclusion.",
            "The problem is, America\u00eds been counting the wrong things. Now we have a president who says the economy is fantastic because the Dow Jones is looking good. I\u00edm sure if you\u00edve got a building with your name on it close to Wall Street, then that really is the same thing as the economy to you. But the problem is, we\u00edve had an economy grow and not be able to lift up those most in need, or even so many in the middle.",
            "When I\u00edm president, we\u00edre going to measure the performance of our economy, not by the Dow Jones but by the income growth of the 90%, because a good economy is one where children are being lifted out of poverty. Just as we focused in South B on cutting the poverty rate, in particular, the black poverty rate and making sure families with children were participating in the growth that we did have. This is one more example of something where the American people want to see change. The American people, not just die hard Democrats, but so many Independents and some Republicans, think we need to prioritize economic equity and yet it still doesn\u00edt happen. That is why we need to recognize that the time has arrived for a different kind of politics. To turn the page, leave the politics of the past in the past and deliver a better future before it is too late."

And I think we need someone to head up this ticket that actually brings people with her, instead of shutting them out. And when I look at a state like New Hampshire that had a very, very close election last time in 2016, I see a state that, yes, has a high voter turnout, fired-up Democrats just like my state, which by the way, Bernie, when I led the ticket, had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country. But I add to that being able to bring in independents like you have in this state as well as moderate Republicans. Because there are so many of them out there that are looking for a candidate. And truthfully, Donald Trump\u00eds worst nightmare is a candidate that will bring people in from the middle. The people that are tired of the noise and the nonsense. And they are tired of the tweets and the mean stuff and they are looking for someone else. And I would submit that that is me.",

And Pete, while you have a different plan now you sent out a tweet just a few years ago that said, henceforth, forewith, indubitably, affirmatively, you are for Medicare for All for the ages. And so I would like to point out that what leadership is about is taking a position, looking at things and sticking with them.

There was courage from Mitt Romney, who took it very, very difficult vote. There was courage, as I read today, about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman being escorted out of the White House, what he did took courage. But what you said, Pete, as you were campaigning through Iowa, as three of us were jurors in that impeachment hearing, you said it was exhausting to watch, and that you wanted to turn the channel and watch cartoons.",
            "It is easy to go after Washington, because that\u00eds a popular thing to do. It is much harder, as I see Senator Shaheen in the front row, such a leader, it is much harder to lead, and much harder to take those difficult positions. Because I think this going after every single thing that people do, because it\u00eds popular to say, and makes you look like a cool newcomer. I just, I don\u00edt think that\u00eds what people want right now. We have a newcomer in the White House, and look where it got us. I think having some experience is a good thing.",
            "I like Bernie just fine. We actually have worked together on a number of things, including pharmaceuticals. We actually had a vote late at night one time, Klobuchar/ Sanders amendment to bring in less-",

To bring in less expensive drugs from other countries, since in this great state of New Hampshire, like in Minnesota and Vermont, we can see Canada from our porch. And we ended up getting I think 14 Republican votes. And they might not have noticed what was happening late at night, but we got those. And I think that it is just an example of what we need to do here, because I\u00edve been listening to this discussion. I agree with my colleagues, we must unite, but the way that we unite is by having an optimistic economic agenda for America. That is what we must do, and that means taking on a president, if you want to talk about being tough enough to take him on.",
            "Taking on a president that literally went down to Mar-a-Lago after he signed that Republican tax bill, and looked at all his friends and said, \u00ecYou just got a lot richer.\u00ee That is exhibit A for those carpenters in Pennsylvania, and those dairy farmers in Wisconsin, and those dock workers that I met with in Michigan. That is an exhibit A, and we have to be able to make the case to the working people of this country, some of whom voted for Donald Trump, that we have something better to offer. That we are going to take those incredibly regressive parts of that tax bill, and put that money into their childcare, into their healththere.",
            "That, I don\u00edt know. I know we did on that bill, but the point is, I think we\u00edre better off with someone that has the receipts. Someone that has actually won big time with Republicans and independents, and I\u00edm the only one up on this stage, you can check it out, that has consistently won in red congressional districts. Not once, not twice, but three times. And when I did this, I didn\u00edt just do it for me. I led a ticket. I\u00edve flipped the state house every single time, because I have a way of working with people, that I think should be valued here as we look at these candidates, and it\u00eds one of the reasons that I got the New York Times endorsement, along with Elizabeth, and that I got the endorsements of the three major papers here in New Hampshire, which is the Union Leader, the Seacoast papers, and the Keene Sentinel. I think that matters. Read those editorials, and you will get a sense of what I\u00edm about.",

And maybe you\u00edre referring to some of the people who were dealing big time in drugs. Yes, I felt that we should prosecute those people, but when it comes to, when you asked Mr. Yang a question, and I think it, we owe it to the people of New Hampshire, had one of the biggest addiction rates in the countries and death rates when it comes to opioids, to explain how we will pay for the treatment and the bed. I\u00edve been very clear about this.",

The evidence is overwhelming, including an email where one guy, a business guy, says to the other, \u00ecThey\u00edre eating them like Doritos. Just keep pumping them out.\u00ee We will get a conservative estimate, $40 billion in from that settlement, we can put a 2 cents per milligram tax on opiods that brings in another 40 billion. Then you can close a hedge fund loophole that brings in $18 billion. And just like every other policy I\u00edve proposed, and I think New Hampshire voters should care about this, I have showed how I\u00edm going to pay for it. Because I think we have someone in the White House that has told over 15,000 lies. He makes all kinds of promises. The people of New Hampshire and the people of our country deserve better. I will get this done and it is personal for me.",

He then dialed it back and said, \u00ecNo, I want to put doctors in jail.\u00ee Is it a big surprise then we\u00edre seeing states like Alabama start enacting laws that would criminalize doctors who perform abortions. It\u00eds not. And that is why it\u00eds going to be really important when you look at the overwhelming public support for funding Planned Parenthood, for making sure women have access to contraception, to making sure that they have a right to choose, that we make this case strongly and loudly.",

But there\u00eds something else insidious going on that we haven\u00edt addressed, and that is the systematic racism when it comes to voting. That is, moves across the country to limit people\u00eds right to vote, and that is why I have been leading on these bills to automatically register every kid to vote in this country when they turn 18. There is no reason that we can\u00edt do that across this country. To stop the gerrymandering by setting up independent commissions in every single state, and yes, to stop the voting purges.",

Why did I vote with them? Because there were some major improvements in this trade agreement when it comes to labor inspections, when it comes to getting rid of a sweetheart pharma deal that was in place and when it comes to climate change, I think we have to have a North American trading block. We have to have Mexico and Canada and America working together and the best way to take on climate change as president, yes, I\u00edll work to make this a part of every future trade agreement, but the best way to take on climate change is by getting back into the international climate change agreement, which I will do on day one.",
            "It is bringing back the clean power rules. It is bringing back the gas mileage standards and it is introducing sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and you cannot divorce trade from that, and in future trade agreements, that should be part of our negotiations. But I\u00edm telling you right now, having no trade agreement with Canada and Mexico puts us at such a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with China and pushing China to do better when it comes to climate change.",
            "One of the things about being in the arena is you have to make decisions all the time and these things aren\u00edt always exactly how you would do them. But in this case, if you want to criticize Trump for not ever having any friends, and I would agree, he always sides with tyrants over innocents. He always sides with dictators over allies, but I think you\u00edve got to have some friends and those two countries, our neighbors, may not be perfect, but they are our friends, and we have a president that literally blames everyone in the world, and we have not talked about this enough.",
            "He blames Barack Obama for everything that goes wrong. He blames his federal reserve chair that he appointed himself. He blames the King of Denmark, who does that? He blames the prime minister of Canada for, he claims, cutting him out of the Canadian version of Home Alone 2, who does that? That\u00eds what Donald Trump does. So my point here is that when we have opportunities to work with our allies, and New Hampshire is such a great example of this, New Hampshire, Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, with senators like Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassen, who believe we need to work with NATO and the rest of the world who sees it as a smaller state, but a state that is a piece of the world. We cannot be alone, and that trade agreement was not perfect, but the point of it is, if we start isolating ourselves from the rest of the world, we are going to hurt ourselves economically and we are going to hurt our nation\u00eds security.",

And there is a way, it\u00eds actually based on a National Academy of Science report and I\u00edve used that to put together a plan to reduce child poverty in half in 10 years and eradicate it in a generation. We can do it with investment in childcare. We can do it with investment in preschool and school and we can do it with tax credits and we can get it done.

No matter who wins this damn thing, we\u00edre all going to stand together to defeat Donald Trump.",

And that is appealing to working class people, who have given up on the political process because they don\u00edt believe that anybody is hearing their pain, perceiving that pain, feeling their pain. And we got to bring young people into the political process. I am very proud that in Iowa we won the popular vote by 6,000 votes. What was most significant, most significant, is we increased voter turnout for young people under 29 by over 30%. If we do that nationally, we\u00edre going to defeat Donald Trump.",

And if that happens nationally, we\u00edre going to win and defeat Trump.",

            "Needless to say, I\u00edve never said that, but let me tell you what I do say. The way you bring people together is by presenting an agenda that works for the working people of this country, not for the billionaire class. The way you bring people together, Republicans, independents, Democrats, progressives, conservatives, you raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. The way you bring people together is to make it clear that we\u00edre not going to give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, they\u00edre going to start paying their fair share of taxes. That\u00eds what the American people want. And I\u00edll tell you something else, the way you bring people together is by ending the international disgrace of this country being the only major nation on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right. And you bring people together by telling the pharmaceutical industry they\u00edre not going to charge us 10 times more for the same prescription drugs as the people in Canada that borders on New Hampshire. That\u00eds how you bring people together and you defeat Donald Trump.",

That\u00eds what Health and Human Services says. [crosstalk 00:15:15] And what we have got to do Joe, and what we have got to do is understand, simple question, Joe, we are spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the healthcare industry last year made $100 billion in profit. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we are wasting $500 billion a year trying to administer thousands and thousands of different plans. What Medicare for All will do is save the average American substantial sums of money. Substantial, be much less expensive than your plan.

Why are we the only major country on earth that doesn\u00edt guarantee healthcare to all people? Pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? Have 87 million people uninsured or under-insured? 30,000 die because they don\u00edt get to a doctor on time, and 500,000 people going bankrupt, for what reason? Because they have cancer or heart disease, or Alzheimer\u00eds. We got to ask that question, why is it why? Why have we been talking about healthcare in this country for a hundred years, and here is the answer. If you want real change in healthcare, at the end of the day, you\u00edre going to have to take on the insurance companies, and tell them the function of healthcare is healthcare for all, not huge profits for the insurance companies. You\u00edre going to have to take on the drug companies, and their corruption, and their price fixing, and tell them, \u00ecSorry, we\u00edre not going to pay 10 times more for prescription drugs, than do the people of other country.\u00ee But at the end of the day, there\u00eds no way around it. You may want to nibble around the edges, but ultimately, you need to rally the American people to tell the drug companies, to tell Wall Street, to tell the insurance companies, to tell the fossil fuel industry this country belongs to all of us, not a handful of special interests.",

There are many conservative Republicans, for example, who are concerned about civil liberties, at least they used to be concerned about civil liberties.

What we have got to do is bring countries around the world together with our power and our wealth and say, you know what, let us sit down and work out our differences through debate and discussion at the UN, not through more and more war and the expenditures of trillions of dollars and the loss of God knows how many lives.",

In Vermont and in New Hampshire and all over this country, people are sickened by the mass shootings that we have seen and the gun violence that we have seen. The world has changed and my views have changed, and my view is right now we need universal background checks, we end the gun show loophole, we end the so called straw man provision.

But in terms of criminal justice, what we have got to do is understand the system is broken, is racist. We invested our young people in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration. We end the war on drugs, which has disproportionately impacted African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans. We end private prisons and detention centers in America.",

What we do have is we have now over six million contributions from one and a half million people averaging $18.50 a contribution. That is unprecedented in the history of American politics. If we want to change America, you\u00edre not going to do it be electing candidates who are going out to rich people\u00eds homes begging for money.

            "Well, the answer to your question of why we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth, disproportionately high for the African American community, by the way, is the same reason that we give massive trillion dollar tax breaks to the rich and large corporations. Same reason that we give tens of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry, while half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. The same reason that we have three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of America.",
            "The same reason that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right. Same reason as to why we are paying in some cases 10 times more than other countries for prescription drugs, and that reason is that our priorities are determined by the 1% and by wealthy campaign contributors. Our priorities are determined by those who want to see the rich get richer and are turning their backs on the working families of this country. What is unique about our campaign, is we say, unashamedly, we are raising our campaign contributions, not from billionaires but from working class people. That our campaign is about the working families of this country for the working class of this country and that is the administration that we will run. It is time to take on the big money interests. It is time to change our national priorities. Thank you."

And I don\u00edt think there\u00eds any question, but that the only way that we\u00edre going to beat him actually is the way that Bernie Sanders said, which is to get turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters. And that means we\u00edre going to have to appeal across the spectrum, moderates, progressives and every group. So unless you can appeal to the diverse parts of the Democratic Party, including specifically the black community, including specifically Latinos. If you can\u00edt do that, then we can\u00edt beat Donald Trump in November and we can\u00edt choose a candidate who can\u00edt do that. And I am doing that right now with 24% of blacks down in South Carolina, with high numbers in Nevada. That\u00eds what it\u00eds going to take is turnout, but turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters.

That is not the question in front of us today. The question in front of us today is, how are we going to beat Donald Trump? You were in the Clinton campaign in 1992, and the mantra was, \u00ecIt\u00eds the economy, stupid.\u00ee Well, if you look at what Mr. Trump is saying, he\u00eds saying those words, \u00ecIt\u00eds the economy, stupid.\u00ee I trust every one of these people a million times more, but we\u00edre going to have to take Mr. Trump down on the economy, because if you listen to him, he\u00eds crowing about it every single day, and he\u00eds going to beat us unless we can take him down on the economy, stupid.

And what we\u00edve actually seen in the Middle East is that Barack Obama used diplomacy to get Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions in return for our releasing economic sanctions along with our partners around the world.

So in fact, what we are listening to right here is a discussion of 20 years of failed military action and how we should continue it and how we should continue spending $700 billion dollars a year on defense when we spend $70 billion dollars a year at the federal level on education.",

We\u00edre talking about something different. The question we have is how are we getting that diverse group of people to the polls? What are we saying? Everybody on this stage feels the same way about a woman\u00eds right to choose and economic justice. The question is how do we beat Trump? How do we take down these Republicans?

I would set up a formal commission on race on day one to retell the story of the last 400 years in America of systematic racism against African Americans, not just legal discrimination, injustice, and cruelty, but also the contribution that the African American community has made to America in building it and in leading the entire country from a moral standpoint for generations and centuries. Because I believe out of narrative comes policy. We need to repair damage that\u00eds been done officially, and pretending we\u00edre all the same is not accurate. We got here a certain way.

Yeah, of course, we want to make things better for American workers, and it\u00eds absolutely critical that when we think about trade policy, we\u00edre thinking about it from the point of view of the American people, not of the American corporations. That\u00eds a huge positive change. And I agree with the senators on that, but there\u00eds something else going on here when we think about our foreign policy.

It\u00eds very simple. That\u00eds what Mr. Trump\u00eds plan is and it\u00eds true in every single red state, but we are not going to win by just criticizing Mr. Trump. I know that there is a better America out there and that America lives in our hearts and minds. And that America understands that when a kid succeeds in Columbia, South Carolina, that is a triumph for every American. And the same is true of a kid in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mr. Trump has no idea what prosperity looks like across this country. It\u00eds not just that he does bad things. He doesn\u00edt understand that investing in education and healthcare and good union jobs is actually an investment in our common humanity and in growth in the future, mobility and justice. That is the America that lives in our hearts and minds that will beat Mr. Trump, because he will never be able to imagine it. So in fact, what we need to do is have a new conception, a new dream of America, dream it and make it happen. Imagine the mountain and then we climb it together. We are in perilous times.

I\u00edve talked before about a two cent wealth tax, but the whole idea behind it is we can do early childhood education and good quality child care, universal pre-K for every three year old and four year old in America, and we can stop exploiting the people, largely black and brown women who do this work and raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America.",
            "We want to have a real future in this country, then invest in our children. Don\u00edt leave public education just to our localities in our states. Be a good federal partner. Put real money into our schools, put real money into housing, put real money into into healthcare. Put real money into the future of our children. That\u00eds how we build the America of our best values."

            "First, let me say America, it\u00eds great to be back on the debate stage. Thank you. I\u00edm so excited, I want to give every American $1,000 a month. George, the entire capitalism, socialism dichotomy is completely out of date and the fact is when people were talking about these economic models, they did not foresee technology getting stronger, more powerful, capable of doing the work of thousands of humans in the blink of an eye. We have record high corporate profits in this country right now, but people in New Hampshire know, what else are at record highs? Mental illness, stress, debt, substance abuse, overdoses, suicides. What we have to do is actually get the markets working to improve our family\u00eds way of life. Instead of following GDP and corporate profits off a cliff, we should be measuring our own health and wellness, life expectancy, mental health and freedom from substance abuse, clean air, and clean water, how our kids are doing. The way forward is a new human centered version of capitalism that actually uses the markets to improve our family\u00eds lives.",
            "George, can I say\u00d6",
            "Pete, fundamentally, you are missing the lesson of Donald Trump\u00eds victory. Donald Trump is not the cause of all of our problems, and we\u00edre making a mistake when we act like he is.",
            "He is a symptom of a disease that has been building up in our communities for years, and decades. And it is our job to get to the harder work of actually curing the disease. Most Americans feel like the political parties have been playing you lose, I lose, you lose, I lose for years. And you know who\u00eds been losing this entire time? We have. Our communities have. Our communities way of life is disintegrating beneath our feet. That\u00eds why Iowa, traditional swing state, went to Trump by almost 10 points. That\u00eds why Ohio, a traditional swing state is now so red, that I\u00edm told we\u00edre not even going to campaign there.",
            "So, these communities are seeing their way of life get blasted into smithereens. We\u00edve automated away four million manufacturing jobs, and counting. We\u00edre closing 30% of New Hampshire stores and malls, and Amazon, the force behind that, is literally paying zero in taxes. These are the changes that Americans are seeing and feeling around us every day, and if we get done the hard work of curing those problems, we will not just defeat Donald Trump in the fall, but we\u00edll actually be able to move our communities forward.",
            "There are of course limits, and you have to see what the facts are on the ground after you assume office, but the fact is, if you look around the world, the countries that have thrown past presidents into jail, have generally been developing countries, and unfortunately that\u00eds a pattern that once you establish, is very, very hard to break. What\u00eds a more American tradition? We move the country forward. We don\u00edt focus on the mistakes of the leaders that are leaving office. Most Americans do not care about what a particular individual did, so much as they care about their family\u00eds wellbeing, their community, their town. That\u00eds where Americans focus wants. They want the American president. They want the present. Of course, the American president, sorry about that. They want the president to be focused on that, and that\u00eds where our attention should be. We should not fall into a pattern that has been disastrous in other countries.",
            "That\u00eds what we have to change, Monica. I\u00edve heard heartbreaking stories from families here in New Hampshire that have been destroyed, torn apart by the opiod epidemic and you have to look at the companies that profited to the tune of tens of billions of dollars in profits of essentially blood money. As President, we will take back those profits and put them to work right here in New Hampshire so that if you are seeking treatment, you have resources to be able to pursue it.",
            "This is not a money problem fundamentally this is a human problem, but money cannot be the obstacle. This is something that happened on the government\u00eds watch. The government allowed this opiod epidemic to spread throughout our communities and we have to do everything in our power to actually make sure that if you are seeking treatment, you know you\u00edre not going to be sent to jail. We have safe injection and safe consumption sites for you.",
            "If you have a family member who\u00eds struggling, you can refer them and know that they\u00edre not going to have criminal penalties as a result. There are so much about this that\u00eds endemic to what\u00eds happened throughout the country in terms of companies running amok, this hyper corporate capitalism where if money\u00eds on one side in this country and people are on the other side, the money is winning. You can see it with the opiate epidemic. You can see it with the military industrial complex, the fossil fuel companies. This is what must change and that\u00eds where I\u00edll lead as president.",
            "Elizabeth, with respect, you can\u00edt regulate away racism with a whole patchwork of laws that are race-specific. What we have to do is heed the writings of Martin Luther King, whose birthday we just celebrated. He said that capitalism forgets that life is social, and what he was championing was a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans of $1000 a month or more that would end up reshaping our economy in communities of color, make it so that black net work is not 10% of white net worth in this country, which is the most important number of them all. We can\u00edt regulate that away through any other means except by putting money directly into the hands of African Americans and Latinos and people of color to allow businesses to actually flourish and grow in those communities. The only way that will happen is if black and Latino consumers have buying power, and that is where we have to move as a country.",
            "The median African American household net work is projected to be zero by 2053. Things are not getting better for people of color. If anything, they\u00edre getting wore, because we\u00edre in the process of eliminating the most common jobs in our economy. It\u00eds something of an economic unnatural disaster, and who suffers most in a natural disaster? People of color, people with lower levels of capital and access to opportunity and education.",
            "And while I know we love to champion education here as Democrats, only 33% of Americans are going attend college, lower percentage of African Americans. There is no way we can prevent this tsunami from wiping out African American net worth unless we put straight cash into their hands sometime between now and 2053, and it\u00eds not just them, it is truck drivers, it is retail clerks, it is call center workers, it is accountants, it is bookkeepers. We are in the midst of the greatest economic transformation in the history of our country, and it\u00eds going to hit black people the hardest. We have to stop nibbling at the edges and actually start solving the real problem.",
            "George, we\u00edre in the midst of the most extreme winner take all economy in the history of our country, and unfortunately, that extremity is just going to reach unprecedented heights as technology is getting stronger, smarter, more capable all the time, and most of us are not. Most adults feel happy if we stayed about the same on any given day. So if we want to alleviate child poverty, we need to put money directly into the hands of families, particularly single parents, 40% of American children today are born to single moms, 90% of single parents are single moms and right now we have fallen into this trap where we have allowed the market to tell us what we are all worth.",
            "What is the market value my wife, Evelyn had, or stay at home parents around the country? Zero. Caregivers taking care of ailing loved ones, like Kyle Christensen in Iowa? Zero. Volunteers and activists in our communities trying to do something positive? Zero. Coaches and mentors helping our kids? Zero. Most artists, sorry artists, but it\u00eds true. Zero. Increasingly local journalists, which is wiping out our ability to have a functioning democracy because you can\u00edt vote on something if you actually don\u00edt have any news coverage. The mission in this campaign has to be for us to disentangle economic value and human value, say they are not the same things and make this case to our fellow Americans. That we each have intrinsic value as citizens, as human beings and as owners and shareholders of the richest country in the history of the world."
