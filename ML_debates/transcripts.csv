2020-02-07,Biden,"Oh, they didnít miss anything. Itís a long race. I took a hit in Iowa and Iíll probably take a hit here. Traditionally Bernie won by 20 points last time. And usually itís the neighboring senators that do well. But no matter what, Iím still in this for the same reason, we have to restore the soul of this country, bring back the middle class and make sure we bring people together. And so itís a simple proposition. It doesnít matter whether itís this one or the next. Iíve always viewed the first four encounters, two primaries, and two caucuses as the starting point. And so thatís how I view it."
2020-02-07,Biden,"Well, you know that with regard to Senator Sanders, the President wants very much to sic a label on every candidate. Weíre going to not only have to win this time, we have to bring along the United States Senate. And Bernieís labeled himself, not me, a democratic socialist. I think thatís the label that the Presidentís going to lay on everyone running with Bernie if heís a nominee. And a Mayor Buttigieg is a great guy and a real patriot. Heís a mayor of a small city, who has done some good things but has not demonstrated he has the ability to, and weíll soon find out, to get a broad scope of support across the spectrum, including African Americans and Latinos."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"Because Donald Trump lies all the time. It doesnít matter what Donald Trump says, itís a sad state of affairs, it really is. He will say terrible things about Joe, he has [inaudible 00:02:32] ugly, disgusting things about Elizabeth, about Amy, about anybody else who was up here. But I think George, that at the end of the day, the way we defeat Donald Trump and everybody up here by the way, is united. No matter who wins this damn thing, weíre all going to stand together to defeat Donald Trump."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"I believe that the way we beat Trump is by having the largest voter turnout in the history of this country. And that is appealing to working class people, who have given up on the political process because they donít believe that anybody is hearing their pain, perceiving that pain, feeling their pain. And we got to bring young people into the political process. I am very proud that in Iowa we won the popular vote by 6,000 votes. What was most significant, most significant, is we increased voter turnout for young people under 29 by over 30%. If we do that nationally, weíre going to defeat Donald Trump."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"Thatís true. And thatís the disappointment and I think all of us probably could have done a better job in bringing out our supporters. But if there is a good spot, a good aspect about that campaign, is that young people came out in higher numbers than they did during Obamaís historic 2008 campaign. And if that happens nationally, weíre going to win and defeat Trump."
2020-02-07,Sanders,Iím not.
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"Bernie and I work together all the time. But I think we are not going to be able to out divide the divider in chief. And I think we need someone to head up this ticket that actually brings people with her, instead of shutting them out. And when I look at a state like New Hampshire that had a very, very close election last time in 2016, I see a state that, yes, has a high voter turnout, fired-up Democrats just like my state, which by the way, Bernie, when I led the ticket, had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country. But I add to that being able to bring in independents like you have in this state as well as moderate Republicans. Because there are so many of them out there that are looking for a candidate. And truthfully, Donald Trumpís worst nightmare is a candidate that will bring people in from the middle. The people that are tired of the noise and the nonsense. And they are tired of the tweets and the mean stuff and they are looking for someone else. And I would submit that that is me."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"I donít think thereís any question, George, that after this week thereís a real threat that Donald Trump can get reelected. And I donít think thereís any question, but that the only way that weíre going to beat him actually is the way that Bernie Sanders said, which is to get turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters. And that means weíre going to have to appeal across the spectrum, moderates, progressives and every group. So unless you can appeal to the diverse parts of the Democratic Party, including specifically the black community, including specifically Latinos. If you canít do that, then we canít beat Donald Trump in November and we canít choose a candidate who canít do that. And I am doing that right now with 24% of blacks down in South Carolina, with high numbers in Nevada. Thatís what itís going to take is turnout, but turnout across the spectrum of democratic voters. Someone who can pull, as Amy said, everything together in every single way weíre divided."
2020-02-07,Yang,"First, let me say America, itís great to be back on the debate stage. Thank you. Iím so excited, I want to give every American $1,000 a month. George, the entire capitalism, socialism dichotomy is completely out of date and the fact is when people were talking about these economic models, they did not foresee technology getting stronger, more powerful, capable of doing the work of thousands of humans in the blink of an eye. We have record high corporate profits in this country right now, but people in New Hampshire know, what else are at record highs? Mental illness, stress, debt, substance abuse, overdoses, suicides. What we have to do is actually get the markets working to improve our familyís way of life. Instead of following GDP and corporate profits off a cliff, we should be measuring our own health and wellness, life expectancy, mental health and freedom from substance abuse, clean air, and clean water, how our kids are doing. The way forward is a new human centered version of capitalism that actually uses the markets to improve our familyís lives."
2020-02-07,Warren,"Oh, Bernie and I have been friends for a long time and we have a lot of things in common and we can have a lot of things that we differ on. But thereís fundamental question about how we bring our party together. We have to think about it in new ways. People across this country, whether theyíre Democrats, independents, or Republicans, understand that weíve got a government right now that works great for those at the top. Works great for giant drug companies, just not for people trying to get a prescription filled. Works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for the rest of us who see climate change bearing down upon us. When you see a government that works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers and make big campaign donations and itís not working so great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple, and we need to call it out for what it is. Corruption, and thatís what we can run on. We bring our party together."
2020-02-07,Warren,"Itís an issue we can all agree on and fight for to end the corruption. Weíre the Democrats, we should be the party on the side of hardworking people and we can bring in independents and Republicans on that. They hate the corruption as well. My anti-corruption plan, good for Republicans and Democrats. Thatís not only how we bring our party together. Thatís how weíre going to win in November."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"Iím not interested in the labels. Iím not interested in what Republicans are going to say. Iím interested in the style of politics that we need to put forward to actually, finally turn the page. In order to win, yes, but also in order to govern. This is a moment where the next president is going to face challenges the likes of which we hadnít even thought of a few years or decades ago. And politically, weíre facing a fundamentally new problem with President Donald Trump. So the biggest risk we could take at a time like this would be to go up against that fundamentally new challenge by trying to fall back on the familiar. Or trying to unite this country at a moment when we need that kind of unification, when our nominee is dividing people with a politics that says, if you donít go all the way to the edge, it doesnít count. A politics that says, itís my way or the highway."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"Yes. Because weíve got to bring as many people as we can into this process. Look, all of us have been saying that we can build the majority that itís going to take in order to win. But the process of actually proving it is now underway. And now it comes to New Hampshire, a state that thinks for itself, is not going to be told what to do by anyone and that has a very independent streak that is going to respond to those who are reaching out in a politics of addition and inclusion and belonging. Not one that beats people over the head and says they shouldnít even be on their side if we donít agree 100% of the time."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"Needless to say, Iíve never said that, but let me tell you what I do say. The way you bring people together is by presenting an agenda that works for the working people of this country, not for the billionaire class. The way you bring people together, Republicans, independents, Democrats, progressives, conservatives, you raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. The way you bring people together is to make it clear that weíre not going to give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations, theyíre going to start paying their fair share of taxes. Thatís what the American people want. And Iíll tell you something else, the way you bring people together is by ending the international disgrace of this country being the only major nation on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right. And you bring people together by telling the pharmaceutical industry theyíre not going to charge us 10 times more for the same prescription drugs as the people in Canada that borders on New Hampshire. Thatís how you bring people together and you defeat Donald Trump."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"I think thereís a better way. Itís true, the American people are ready. Thereís a historic majority right now, even broader than what was available to President Obama a decade ago. There is now a majority ready to act to make sure there is no such thing as an uninsured American and no such thing as an unaffordable prescription. Just so long as we donít command people to accept a public plan if they donít want to. Thatís the idea of Medicare for All Who Want It. My point is, what I am offering is campaigning for all of these things that America wants. Yes, higher wages, doubling the rate of unionization in this country, making corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share, delivering healthcare and college affordability. But also offering a way to do these game changing transformations that will actually galvanize and energize, not polarize the American people. That is not only what we need in order to win, itís what we need in order to govern and actually get these things done."
2020-02-07,Biden,"Look, Bernie says that you have to bring people together and we have to have Medicare for All. But Bernie says, and he says he wrote the damn thing, but heís unwilling to sell us with the damn thingís going to cost. The fact that weíre in New Hampshire, very levelheaded group of people, look at the numbers. How much is it going to cost? Whoís going to pay for it? It will cost more than the entire, the entire federal budget we spend now, more than entire budget. The idea middle class taxes arenít going to go up is just crazy. When they did it in Vermont, what happened? They doubled the state income tax and then had a 14% tax on withholding. And they finally did away with it. So how much is it going to cost? When you ask Bernie that, and Iíll ask him again tonight sometime, and if you ask Bernie that, he says, ìGo figure, I donít know, weíll find out.î"
2020-02-07,Biden,"I think that was on CBS. He said, î Weíll find out.î Or something to that effect. Imagine youíre going to unite the country walking into the Congress, ìI got this bill. Itís going to require Medicare for everybody. I canít tell you how much itís going to cost. Weíll find out later and itís likely to be double whatever Ö everything we spent in the federal government.î Who do you think is going to get that passed? I busted my neck getting Obamacare passed, getting every Democratic vote. I know how hard it is."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"Well, for a start, what the studies show, if we do what Joe wants, weíll be spending some $50 trillion on healthcare over the next 10 years. Thatís the status quo, Joe. Thatís what Health and Human Services says. [crosstalk 00:15:15] And what we have got to do Joe, and what we have got to do is understand, simple question, Joe, we are spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the healthcare industry last year made $100 billion in profit. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we are wasting $500 billion a year trying to administer thousands and thousands of different plans. What Medicare for All will do is save the average American substantial sums of money. Substantial, be much less expensive than your plan. And we will expand Medicare to include dental care, eyeglasses, hearing aides and home health care as well."
2020-02-07,Biden,30 second-
2020-02-07,Biden,"30 second response. My proposal gives you a choice. Youíre going to be covered. You have Medicare if you want it, you turn [inaudible 00:16:16] weíre going to restore all the cuts that they made in Obamacare. Weíre going to reduce drug prices, reduce prescription prices, reduce copays, et cetera. And it cost a lot of money, it costs $750 billion over 10 years. I tell you how Iím going to pay for it. Iím going to raise the capital gains rates, you pay capital gains and what your tax rate is. Thatíll pay for it, thatís $800 billion. But hereís the deal, the fact is that itís going to cost Ö Bernieís plan costs double, double what the taxpayers are paying for every single program we spend on in the United States of America."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"I keep listening to this same debate, and it is not real. It is not real, Bernie, because two thirds of the Democrats in the Senate are not on your bill and because it would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years. And let me say what else, Elizabeth wants to do it in two years. And Pete, while you have a different plan now you sent out a tweet just a few years ago that said, henceforth, forewith, indubitably, affirmatively, you are for Medicare for All for the ages. And so I would like to point out that what leadership is about is taking a position, looking at things and sticking with them. I have long believed that the way that we expand healthcare to more people and bring down premiums is by building on the Affordable Care Act, with a nonprofit public option. That is the best way to do it."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"And practically look at this, the Affordable Care Act is now nearly 10 points more popular than the President of United States. So why would we talk about blowing it up? What we need to do is build on it. Mental health care, addiction, longterm care, those are the things that would make it better for everyone."
2020-02-07,Warren,"So I think we need to think about healthcare a little differently and that is, 36 million Americans last year couldnít afford to have a prescription filled and that includes people with health insurance. I want everyone in here to think about what that means. They were worried enough or sick enough that they went to a doctor, a doctor looked at it and says thatís serious enough to write a prescription. They walked out and then said, itís either that or groceries. Itís that or pay them rent on time. We have got to change our healthcare system. The way [no audio or video 00:18:34] Help to the most people as quickly as we can. How about we start with what a president can do, I love saying this, all by herself. On day one, I will defend the Affordable Care Act and I will use march in orders to reduce the cost of commonly used prescription drugs like insulin and HIV, AIDS, drugs and EpiPens."
2020-02-07,Warren,"We can start making healthcare better for Americans from the beginning, but we have to agree to do that. We are the Democrats, we are on the side of expanding healthcare. When we come up against Donald Trump, the team that has been trying to take away healthcare from millions of people, whatís going to matter most is we are the people on the side of those who need healthcare across this country. Thatís who Democrats are."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"Sure. Well, first of all, just to be clear, the truth is that I have been consistent throughout in my position on delivering healthcare for every American. And as to experience, I just bring a different perspective. Look, I freely admit that if youíre looking for the person with the most years of Washington establishment experience under their belt, youíve got your candidate, and of course itís not me. The perspective Iím bringing is that of somebody whose life has been shaped by the decisions that are made in those big white buildings in Washington, D.C. Somebody who has guided a community written off as dying just a decade ago through historic transformation. Somebody who knows what it means to be sent to war on orders that come out of the Situation Room. We need a perspective right now that will finally allow us to leave the politics of the past in the past. Turn the page and bring change to Washington before itís too late."
2020-02-07,Biden,"The politics of the past I think were not all that bad. I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. I managed the $900 billion Recovery Act, which in fact put millions and millions of dollars into his city before he came and helped save his city. I was able to do it, I was able to pass the chemical weapons ban, arms control. And I was the first major leader holding public office to call for same sex marriage. So I donít know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden was so bad. What happened? What is it that he wants to do away with? We were just beginning."
2020-02-07,Biden,"Ö Happened, what is it that he wants to do away with? We were just beginning. It was just the beginning of what will be the future of moving this country beyond where it is now in significant ways, and thereís ways to do that, and one of the ways to do that is to make sure you have someone who knows how to get things done, and can lead the free world at the same time."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"Those achievements were phenomenally important, because they met the moment, but now we have to meet this moment. And this moment is different. The next president is going to face challenges from global health security, like what weíre seeing coming out of China, to cybersecurity, and election security challenges that were barely thought of a few years ago. And here at home, weíre seeing things like gig work, transform what it means to be a worker in America, in ways that were barely conceived of not that long ago. We cannot solve the problems before us by looking back. We have to be ready to turn the page, and change our politics before itís too late. And Iím seeing everywhere I go, not just fellow Democrats, but a striking number of independents, and, what I like to call future former Republicans ready to join in that historic American majority to turn the page."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"I am listening to this about meeting the moment, and my first thought is, Iím a fresh face up here for a presidential debate, and I figure, Pete, that 59, my age, is the new 38 up here. The second thing I think about is this, and that is-"
2020-02-07,Sanders,70 is the new 50.
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"Okay, there you go. Meeting the moment, meeting the moment, we had a moment the last few weeks, mayor, and that moment was these impeachment hearings. And there was a lot of courage that you saw from only a few people. There was courage from Doug Jones, our friend of Alabama, who took that tough vote. There was courage from Mitt Romney, who took it very, very difficult vote. There was courage, as I read today, about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman being escorted out of the White House, what he did took courage. But what you said, Pete, as you were campaigning through Iowa, as three of us were jurors in that impeachment hearing, you said it was exhausting to watch, and that you wanted to turn the channel and watch cartoons."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"It is easy to go after Washington, because thatís a popular thing to do. It is much harder, as I see Senator Shaheen in the front row, such a leader, it is much harder to lead, and much harder to take those difficult positions. Because I think this going after every single thing that people do, because itís popular to say, and makes you look like a cool newcomer. I just, I donít think thatís what people want right now. We have a newcomer in the White House, and look where it got us. I think having some experience is a good thing."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"George, George, can IÖ"
2020-02-07,Yang,"George, can I sayÖ"
2020-02-07,Sanders,"Look, at the end of the day, we got to ask ourselves a very simple question, whether itís healthcare in fact, or anything else. Why are we the only major country on earth that doesnít guarantee healthcare to all people? Pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? Have 87 million people uninsured or under-insured? 30,000 die because they donít get to a doctor on time, and 500,000 people going bankrupt, for what reason? Because they have cancer or heart disease, or Alzheimerís. We got to ask that question, why is it why? Why have we been talking about healthcare in this country for a hundred years, and here is the answer. If you want real change in healthcare, at the end of the day, youíre going to have to take on the insurance companies, and tell them the function of healthcare is healthcare for all, not huge profits for the insurance companies. Youíre going to have to take on the drug companies, and their corruption, and their price fixing, and tell them, ìSorry, weíre not going to pay 10 times more for prescription drugs, than do the people of other country.î But at the end of the day, thereís no way around it. You may want to nibble around the edges, but ultimately, you need to rally the American people to tell the drug companies, to tell Wall Street, to tell the insurance companies, to tell the fossil fuel industry this country belongs to all of us, not a handful of special interests."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"I have heard this conversation on this debate stage from these people now every single debate, and theyíre all right, everybody on this stage is better on economic justice and healthcare than anybody in the Republican party, and a million times better than Donald Trump. That is not the question in front of us today. The question in front of us today is, how are we going to beat Donald Trump? You were in the Clinton campaign in 1992, and the mantra was, ìItís the economy, stupid.î Well, if you look at what Mr. Trump is saying, heís saying those words, ìItís the economy, stupid.î I trust every one of these people a million times more, but weíre going to have to take Mr. Trump down on the economy, because if you listen to him, heís crowing about it every single day, and heís going to beat us unless we can take him down on the economy, stupid. And thatís the issue here. It is not about who has the best healthcare plan. All the healthcare plans are better, a million times better."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"The question is, who can go toe to toe with Mr. Trump? Who can take down Mr. Trump, because heís the real threat to the country? And let me say, you have to have experience to take him down. This is not a question of heís a nice guy whoís going to listen. We need people with experience. Thatís why Iím worried about Mayor Pete. You need to be able to go toe to toe with this guy, and take him down on the debate stage, or weíre going to lose. And thatís actually the issue in front of democratic voters. I have heard this debate so many darn times, and I love all these people, and theyíre all right. If we win, we can get the right thing, Bernie. I am with you. If we win, we can get the right thing, Pete, and Amy, but we got to win, or we are in deep trouble, and we keep not talking about the facts."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"Hereís how weíre going to win. Weíre going to force this president to stand on that debate stage, next to somebody who actually lives in a middle class neighborhood, in the industrial Midwest, in the exact kind of community that he pretends to speak for, but turns his back on. Weíre going to put up somebody whoís not afraid to call out things like his disgraceful behavior at the national prayer breakfast, and remind Americans that God does not belong to a political party. Weíre going to win by having somebody up there who can call him to account for his refusal to serve when it was his turn, and remind him what serving this country is really about. If we want to beat this president, weíve got to be ready to move on from the playbook that we have relied on in the past, and unify this country around a new and better vision. Thatís how weíre going to win. And when I talk about exhaustion, this is important, because I got to tell you, the American people, from outside of Washington, we feel a sense of exhaustion watching the division, and the dysfunction there."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"And that is not to take anything away from the very good work that you and our other democratic members of Congress, and the Senate are doing. Itís not. But, the reason I raise that sense of exhaustion is I see it. I see that temptation to walk away from it all among so many people that Iíve spoken to in communities from Claremont to Manchester, and in the other states that weíre in. And the important thing for the American people to remember, is this is 2020, itís an election year. And if the Senate was the jury before, you are the jury now. The American people are the jury that will have the final verdict on this president, and on the senators in the GOP who protected him."
2020-02-07,Yang,"Pete, fundamentally, you are missing the lesson of Donald Trumpís victory. Donald Trump is not the cause of all of our problems, and weíre making a mistake when we act like he is."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,Thatís right.
2020-02-07,Yang,"He is a symptom of a disease that has been building up in our communities for years, and decades. And it is our job to get to the harder work of actually curing the disease. Most Americans feel like the political parties have been playing you lose, I lose, you lose, I lose for years. And you know whoís been losing this entire time? We have. Our communities have. Our communities way of life is disintegrating beneath our feet. Thatís why Iowa, traditional swing state, went to Trump by almost 10 points. Thatís why Ohio, a traditional swing state is now so red, that Iím told weíre not even going to campaign there."
2020-02-07,Yang,"So, these communities are seeing their way of life get blasted into smithereens. Weíve automated away four million manufacturing jobs, and counting. Weíre closing 30% of New Hampshire stores and malls, and Amazon, the force behind that, is literally paying zero in taxes. These are the changes that Americans are seeing and feeling around us every day, and if we get done the hard work of curing those problems, we will not just defeat Donald Trump in the fall, but weíll actually be able to move our communities forward."
2020-02-07,Warren,"Look, I think no one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. We watched on Wednesday as Republicans, all but one locked arms to protect him from impeachment, but we need to reestablish the rule of law in this country. I believe in an independent commission, in our justice department that investigates crimes committed by our own government. It is an important part of accountability. It is an important part for every administration, that we hold ourselves accountable to the American people. Look, people around this country are losing faith in our government. Theyíre losing faith that government works for them. They see a government that just works great if youíre rich. It works great if youíre a lobbyist. It works great if youíre a corporate executive, but they see themselves and their children with less and less and less, and we could do something about it."
2020-02-07,Warren,"Itís not enough simply to talk about the future. We have to be willing to stand up to those who now control our government, and make that government instead work for us. We can do child care in this country for every baby. We can invest in our public schools. We can cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans, but only if we are willing to take control of our government away from the giant corporations and billionaires, return it to the people. This is about our government. This is about our democracy. This is about our future."
2020-02-07,Yang,"There are of course limits, and you have to see what the facts are on the ground after you assume office, but the fact is, if you look around the world, the countries that have thrown past presidents into jail, have generally been developing countries, and unfortunately thatís a pattern that once you establish, is very, very hard to break. Whatís a more American tradition? We move the country forward. We donít focus on the mistakes of the leaders that are leaving office. Most Americans do not care about what a particular individual did, so much as they care about their familyís wellbeing, their community, their town. Thatís where Americans focus wants. They want the American president. They want the present. Of course, the American president, sorry about that. They want the president to be focused on that, and thatís where our attention should be. We should not fall into a pattern that has been disastrous in other countries."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"Along with Elizabeth and Amy, we sat for two weeks listening to the impeachment process, and hereís what I think the horror and the danger of what happened was not only the acquittal of Trump, who in fact committed impeachable offenses, and obstructed Congress. It is the precedent that it set. The precedent that it set. And what that precedent is about now is in the future, youíre going to have presidents who say, ìHey, governor, you want highway money? You better support me, or youíre not going to get it.î Because I am the president, I can do anything I want."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"Hey, Congress, you want to investigate me? Donít be ridiculous. Who cares about the Congress? Who cares about the separation of powers? Who cares about the constitution of the president? Iím the President of the United States. I have all of the power, and Iím able to intimidate members of my own party. The saddest aspect of this whole thing, is you have Republicans in the Senate who knew better. They knew that Donald Trump is a crook. They knew that Donald Trump is a cheat, but they didnít have the guts, with the exception of Romney to vote against him. That is a sad day."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"So, I did start the Need to Impeach movement in October of 2017. And my father was one of the people who prosecuted the Nazi war criminals after World War II. And thatís part of the reason I started it. Because when you see something really wrong in the United States, youíre supposed to stand up against it, and fight against it. And thatís what I was doing. But heís been, the Republicans have rolled over, theyíve had a sham trial, theyíve refused to have witnesses. Theyíve covered up the truth for the American people. And it doesnít matter anymore that heís a crook, and heís always been a crook, and he always will be a crook. Right now, what we have to do is we have to beat him in November, and we have to beat him because heís incompetent, and bad for the American people. And thatís the case we have to make now."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"Is he a crook? I knew that two years ago. Is he going to be more of a crook, now that he believes he can get away with anything? Of course he is. But the job of the people on this stage is to beat him in November, and thatís going to be based on what we can deliver for the American people. The fact that heís incompetent as a president, his economy isnít delivering for working people. The jobs donít pay enough for people to live on. Weíve got to take him down on the economy, and get them out of the White House as soon as possible."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"No, and weíre not going to let them change the subject. This is not about Hunter Biden, or vice president Biden, or any Biden. This is about an abuse of power by the president. The vice president and I and all of us are competing. But weíve got to draw a line here. And to be the kind of president, to be the kind of human being who would seek to turn someone against his own son, who would seek to weaponize a son against his own father, is an unbelievably dishonorable thing, that is just one more example of why we as a party have to be completely united in doing whatever it takes at the end of the day to make sure that this president does not get a second term."
2020-02-07,Biden,"I thank my colleague for saying that. It is a diversion, but hereís the deal. Whomever the nominee is, the presidentís going to make up lies about. He thinks he has free reign right now. One of the things that I think is really important is we have to be authentic with the American people about what weíre going to do and how weíre going to do it. And by the way, Colonel Vindman got thrown out of the White House, walked out. I think at the same time, he should have been pinning a medal on Vindman, and not on rush Limbaugh. And I think we should all stand and give Colonel Vindman a show of how much we supported him. Stand up and clap for Vindman. Get up there. Who we are. Thatís who we are. We are not what Trump is."
2020-02-07,Sanders,I wasnít able to hear that question.
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"I like Bernie just fine. We actually have worked together on a number of things, including pharmaceuticals. We actually had a vote late at night one time, Klobuchar/ Sanders amendment to bring in less-"
2020-02-07,Sanders,I thought it was Sanders/Klobuchar?
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"Nope, nope, nope, it was not, it was not. To bring in less expensive drugs from other countries, since in this great state of New Hampshire, like in Minnesota and Vermont, we can see Canada from our porch. And we ended up getting I think 14 Republican votes. And they might not have noticed what was happening late at night, but we got those. And I think that it is just an example of what we need to do here, because Iíve been listening to this discussion. I agree with my colleagues, we must unite, but the way that we unite is by having an optimistic economic agenda for America. That is what we must do, and that means taking on a president, if you want to talk about being tough enough to take him on."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"Taking on a president that literally went down to Mar-a-Lago after he signed that Republican tax bill, and looked at all his friends and said, ìYou just got a lot richer.î That is exhibit A for those carpenters in Pennsylvania, and those dairy farmers in Wisconsin, and those dock workers that I met with in Michigan. That is an exhibit A, and we have to be able to make the case to the working people of this country, some of whom voted for Donald Trump, that we have something better to offer. That we are going to take those incredibly regressive parts of that tax bill, and put that money into their childcare, into their healththere."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"That, I donít know. I know we did on that bill, but the point is, I think weíre better off with someone that has the receipts. Someone that has actually won big time with Republicans and independents, and Iím the only one up on this stage, you can check it out, that has consistently won in red congressional districts. Not once, not twice, but three times. And when I did this, I didnít just do it for me. I led a ticket. Iíve flipped the state house every single time, because I have a way of working with people, that I think should be valued here as we look at these candidates, and itís one of the reasons that I got the New York Times endorsement, along with Elizabeth, and that I got the endorsements of the three major papers here in New Hampshire, which is the Union Leader, the Seacoast papers, and the Keene Sentinel. I think that matters. Read those editorials, and you will get a sense of what Iím about."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"I must confess, I donít get too many newspaper editorial support. Must confess that."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"Well, you the Conway endorsement."
2020-02-07,Sanders,I did. Weíre very proud of that.
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,There we go.
2020-02-07,Sanders,"But, let me just say this. I think the question started off with Secretary Clintonís critique. I think, quite honestly, as we face one of the great political crises facing America, our job is to look forward and not back to 2016. And I hope that Secretary Clinton and all of us can come together, and move in that direction. Now, second of all, in terms of Republicans, let me sayÖ"
2020-02-07,Sanders,"-in that direction. Now, second of all, in terms of Republicans, let me say that in my own great state of Vermont, if my memory is correct, Amy, I got 25% of the Republican vote. And in fact, there were periods when I was in the House of Representatives, a number of years where I passed more amendments on the floor of the House in a bipartisan way than any other member of the House and that is when you bring people together on an issue. There are many conservative Republicans, for example, who are concerned about civil liberties, at least they used to be concerned about civil liberties. There are Republicans, as you know, who are concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs. There are ways that we can work with Republicans on issues where we have a common basis."
2020-02-07,Sanders,Letís do that.
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"In the situation that we saw with President Trumpís decision, there is no evidence that that made our country safer. Look, I feel very strongly about the campaign of murder and mayhem that General Soleimani and his units have perpetrated. Itís also the case that if we learned nothing else from the war in Iraq, itís that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea if you do not know what you were doing. This president has moved us this much closer to the brink of war, but it didnít start with the Soleimani strike. It started with withdrawing us from the Iran nuclear deal that his own administration certified was working. And itís time for us to recognize that every time a step is taken that moves us to the brink of war, that has incredibly serious consequences for those who serve."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"By chance, just because I was traveling for the campaign, not long ago, I ran into somebody that I hadnít seen since we were both serving, hadnít seen since she was injured in an insider attack. And I saw her coming down the concourse in the airport wearing a Wounded Warrior Project tee shirt that said, ìSome assembly required.î And when I asked her how she was doing, she up her knee and tapped on the part of her leg that they couldnít save, tapped on the prosthetic and said the Navy had fixed her up just fine and then let me know that she was looking forward to an upcoming deployment."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"The people in our uniform will do whatever the United States requires of them. What they deserve in return is a president who will actually read the intelligence, pay attention to the international security situation, consult with our allies, keep US politics out of it, and never commit our troops to a situation where they would have to go into harmís way if there is an alternative."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"It depends on the circumstances. It depends if there was an alternative and it depends what the different effects would be. Thatís my point. This is not an episode of 24. This is a situation that requires that you actually evaluate the entire intelligence picture. This president has insulted the intelligence community, but they put their lives on the line to gather the information that will help a decision maker evaluate whether or not something like that is justified. And I donít think he even reads it."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"And here we have a situation where the world, that one of the most volatile places in the world has just become more dangerous at the hands of a president who has no regard for the military, not only punishing a war hero today with what he did to Colonel Vindman, but pardoning war criminals in a way that undermines the entire sense of good order and discipline and military honor. We deserve a better commander-in-chief."
2020-02-07,Biden,"No. And the reason I wouldnít have ordered the strike, there is no evidence yet of imminent threat that was going to come from him. Look what happened, his America First policies made America alone. You cannot think of a time, David, and as long as youíve been alive when NATO has said to the United States of America and to Iran, made a moral equivalence and said, both of you stand down. We are alone now, alone in that region of the world, without friends, without support, without allies."
2020-02-07,Biden,"And secondly, you saw what happened when that air raid, when those missiles were fired from Iran into Iraq at Al-Assad Airbase, 64 of our heroes were wounded. I donít know what I wouldíve done if my son were still there. I would have been so damn angry. I donít know what I wouldíve done. But hereís what happened, they had received traumatic brain injury. What did the president say? He said, ìheadaches,î ìnot bad,î ìHeadaches, thatís all they are.î This guy doesnít deserve to be commander- in-chief for one more day."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"Right. Look, here is the danger, David, there are very bad leaders all over the world. Kim Jong-un in North Korea is probably responsible for the death of hundreds of thousands of his people threatening all of Asia with nuclear weapons. You got Mohammad Bin Salman in Saudi Arabia who is a terrible murderer, who murdered Khashoggi in cold blood and dismembered his body. You have Putin in Russia who has been involved in political assassinations of his enemies. You got Xi in China who has put a million Muslims into concentration camps."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"You cannot go around saying youíre a bad guy, weíre going to assassinate you, and then youíre going to have, if that happens, youíre opening the door to international anarchy that every government in the world will then be subjected to attacks and assassination. What we have got to do, which Trump does not understand, is strengthen the State Department and our diplomatic capabilities, not just the military. What we have got to do is bring countries around the world together with our power and our wealth and say, you know what, let us sit down and work out our differences through debate and discussion at the UN, not through more and more war and the expenditures of trillions of dollars and the loss of God knows how many lives."
2020-02-07,Warren,"No. Look, I sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee, so I get the briefings from the generals on a regular basis. Iíve been to Afghanistan, to Iraq. Iíve been to Jordan. Iíve been throughout the region. Iíve been there with John McCain. Iíve been there with Lindsey Graham to ask the hard questions about whatís happening, to ask our generals, to ask their generals to ask people who are on the ground. And the bottom line is, nobody sees a solution to this war. Nobody can describe what winning looks like. All they can describe is endless war."
2020-02-07,Warren,"And I realized there are people on this debate stage who are willing to say, yeah, weíll leave our troops there for five more years, for 10 more years. Lindsey Graham has said heís willing to leave troops for 100 more years. And yet, what has all these years of war brought us? Right now, the Afghan Government controls less than 60% of the land. People donít have faith in it. Itís a corrupt government. The opium trade is higher than ever."
2020-02-07,Warren,"Look, we sent our troops in and they did their best. They were there for us, but we need to be there for them. And that means, not send our troops to do work that cannot be solved militarily. It is time to bring our combat troops home. It is time to stop this endless war in Afghanistan."
2020-02-07,Warren,Yes.
2020-02-07,Warren,"So I want to hear the plan, not just a, we need it now, we need it for the next day, we need it for the six months. And I want to know where our allies are. We all have an interest in dealing with terrorism and controlling terrorism, but that means it canít just be the United States waging endless war. That does not make us safer. It does not make the region safer. It does not make the world safer. We should work with our allies in managing terrorism, but we need to end this war in Afghanistan. We cannot wait five more years, or 10 more years, or until we turn the corner 10 more times. We need to bring our combat troops home."
2020-02-07,Biden,"Iím not sure what she, if she wants to pull all troops out of the Middle East, but if she does want to put all troops out of the Middle East, we saw what happens when that happened."
2020-02-07,Biden,"I helped put together a 61 nation group to take out ISIS by putting fewer than 5,000 forces along the Turkish border to see to it that they, and they lost 10,000, the Kurds, lost 10,000 lives. They defeated ISIS. They ended the caliphate and then the president on a whim dealing with a man I know very well, theyíve now, the guy running Turkey who is more of an autocrat now than a Democrat, and what happened? We pulled out and you saw what happened. You saw the end of the effort to be able to continue to contain, contain ISIS, number one."
2020-02-07,Biden,"Number two, close your eye, everybody. Remember what you saw on television. You saw a woman standing up there holding up her baby, Kurd, saying, ìPlease donít leave us.î And our military women and men standing at, going out in their [inaudible 00:53:49] Humvees with their heads down ashamed of what they did. It didnít take a lot of men or men and women to do what needed to be done."
2020-02-07,Biden,"And with regard Afghanistan, now I can say it because it was made public, I was totally against the whole notion of no nation building in Afghanistan. The only thing we should be doing is dealing with terrorism in that region. Iíve been in every part of Afghanistan, not in combat like my friend has, but in helicopter and/or on a vehicle in every part of it as senator and vice president. Hereís what I saw, there is no possibility of uniting that country, no possibility at all of making it a whole country. But it is possible to see to it that theyíre not able to launch more attacks from the region on the United States of America. Thatís a small footprint that we needed and I argued for that in the beginning."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"I believe that I have the judgment to help us get through these situations where obviously the vice president made the wrong decision when it came to such an important moment in our foreign policy. And looking forward, we got to recognize just how much is going to be on the plate of the next president that is different in kind from what we have faced before. Itís not just about dealing with the aftermath of the war in Iraq, itís about preventing a war with Iran. And not only do we have to undertake the military and counter terrorism activities that weíve been doing throughout, the next president is going to have to restore the credibility of this country among our allies and among the international community."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"At a moment when we are facing fundamentally different challenges from asymmetric warfare to cybersecurity threats, in President Trumpís imagination of a national security strategy is a big wall and a moat full of alligators. Itís a 17th century approach to keeping a place safe. What we have to do is be ready for the future and that means insisting not only on shoring up our relationships, but defining a strategy to keep the American people safe from fundamentally new challenges."
2020-02-07,Biden,"I made a mistake and I said it 14 years ago. I trusted George Bush to keep his word. He said he was not going to go into Iraq. He said he was only using this to unite the United Nations to insist we get inspectors in to see what Saddam was doing. When we got elected, the president turned to me with the entire security apparatus and said, ìJoe, I want you to organize getting 156,000 troops out of Iraq.î I did that. I did that."
2020-02-07,Biden,"The other thing I want to point out too is that NATO is in fact going to crumble if we donít beat Trump. NATO is in real trouble. We need NATO for more reasons than just physical security. We need NATO to make sure that we do not allow Russia to continue to have its influence in Eastern Europe in ways that it had before. It wasnít just to stop the Soviet Union from coming into the United States, coming into Europe. It was to make sure that we did not have a kleptocracy taking over that part of the world, to unite Europe in our behalf. I know how to deal with them. I know every one of these world leaders by their first names. They call me. I talked to them and I believe I can get it done."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"Well, let me say this, I agree with Pete Buttigieg that itís about judgment not tenure. What weíre hearing here is a very long dissertation about exactly how America should be the worldís policemen. And what weíve actually seen in the Middle East is that Barack Obama used diplomacy to get Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions in return for our releasing economic sanctions along with our partners around the world. So when weíre talking about our role in the world and commander-in-chief, we have abandoned a diplomacy. We donít have a strategy and we donít have allies."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"And actually this view of the world, that our response should be military is driven by our gigantic military complex and ignores the biggest problem that we face internationally in the world, which is climate change. And it cannot be solved with guns and tanks and planes. It can only be solved with diplomacy and allies and interaction with other countries. So in fact, what we are listening to right here is a discussion of 20 years of failed military action and how we should continue it and how we should continue spending $700 billion dollars a year on defense when we spend $70 billion dollars a year at the federal level on education."
2020-02-07,Steyer,Letís talk about judgment here. [crosstalk 00:59:16].
2020-02-07,Biden,"Thatís not what I said, I was part of the reason putting that deal together with Iran. I was there. I was involved in that. I was also part of the deal putting together the Paris Climate Accord. I brought in the Chinese. I was part of that. Iíve been part of every major initiative weíve had relative to diplomacy. I have not argued for the placement of major numbers of US combat troops. I have said, along with the President of the United States, Barack Obama as his partner, I have said, we have to strengthen NATO to make it clear that we keep our commitments when we make them. Like we donít keep our commitments to the Kurds. We must keep our commitments when we make them. Otherwise, we have no power whatsoever."
2020-02-07,Biden,"And itís not about making sure weíre policeman of the world. The only way not to become the policeman of the world is to have allies who will join us in dealing with failed States and terrorism. And it has to be done jointly by a whole lot of people and it doesnít require large number of US troops, and Iíve never said that."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"Okay, can I respond to that, David?"
2020-02-07,Steyer,Can I respond to [crosstalk 01:00:22].
2020-02-07,Sanders,"Let me say this if I might, like Joe and others, I also heard the arguments in terms of the war in Iraq from Bush, from Cheney, from John Bolton, from the whole administration. I listened very carefully and I concluded that they were lying through their teeth. And I not only voted against that war, but I help lead the opposition. And it saddens me so much. If you hear what I said, itís on YouTube, my fears about all the destabilization that would take place by the US invading Iraq. Itís sad to me that, that is what happened."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"But let me just pick up on a point that Tom made, which is absolutely right. Trump wants to build a wall around America. The problem is if we are going to deal with issues like climate change, not only do we in America have to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry, we have to lead the entire world. This is not an American issue. Itís a global issue. We got to bring China and Russia and Brazil and Pakistan and India and every major country on earth into the fight against climate change."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"And here is my dream, maybe itís a radical dream, but maybe just may be given the crisis of climate change, the world can understand that instead of spending $1.8 trillion dollars a year collectively on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,No. What Iíve called for is that incarceration should no longer be the response to drug possession.
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"Again, what Iím calling for is that we end the use of incarceration as a response. This does not mean that it will be lawful to produce or distribute those kinds of harmful drugs, but also as we know from the opioid crisis, some of this has been driven by companies that were acting irresponsibly with substances that were lawful. Itís why in South Bend we sued those companies to hold them accountable. Weíve got to make sure that there is accountability for those who suppressed evidence about the addictiveness of those substances. Even while weíre also coming to recognize that these kinds of addiction are a medical issue, not a moral failure on the part of somebody battling that addiction."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"Thatís why medication assisted treatment is so important. And those people who are being revived, and our own EMTs in my city had been so frustrated by the experience of reviving somebody, but then they have nowhere to go. Sometimes you get brought back with a dose of Narcan, but then your life depends on whether in the days that follow you make it until somebody can actually see you, because we have such a shortage of mental health and addiction providers in this country. We must act to change that and save lives when we do."
2020-02-07,Yang,"Thatís what we have to change, Monica. Iíve heard heartbreaking stories from families here in New Hampshire that have been destroyed, torn apart by the opiod epidemic and you have to look at the companies that profited to the tune of tens of billions of dollars in profits of essentially blood money. As President, we will take back those profits and put them to work right here in New Hampshire so that if you are seeking treatment, you have resources to be able to pursue it."
2020-02-07,Yang,"This is not a money problem fundamentally this is a human problem, but money cannot be the obstacle. This is something that happened on the governmentís watch. The government allowed this opiod epidemic to spread throughout our communities and we have to do everything in our power to actually make sure that if you are seeking treatment, you know youíre not going to be sent to jail. We have safe injection and safe consumption sites for you."
2020-02-07,Yang,"If you have a family member whoís struggling, you can refer them and know that theyíre not going to have criminal penalties as a result. There are so much about this thatís endemic to whatís happened throughout the country in terms of companies running amok, this hyper corporate capitalism where if moneyís on one side in this country and people are on the other side, the money is winning. You can see it with the opiate epidemic. You can see it with the military industrial complex, the fossil fuel companies. This is what must change and thatís where Iíll lead as president."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"I led one of the most successful drug courts in the country in Hennepin County, and I always would say and believed, and I think my record shows this, that we werenít a business. We didnít want to see repeat customers. And if you donít want to see repeat customers, the only answer is treatment. And maybe youíre referring to some of the people who were dealing big time in drugs. Yes, I felt that we should prosecute those people, but when it comes to, when you asked Mr. Yang a question, and I think it, we owe it to the people of New Hampshire, had one of the biggest addiction rates in the countries and death rates when it comes to opioids, to explain how we will pay for the treatment and the bed. Iíve been very clear about this."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"Thereís going to be a major settlement coming through, a federal settlement against all these opioid manufacturers. The evidence is overwhelming, including an email where one guy, a business guy, says to the other, ìTheyíre eating them like Doritos. Just keep pumping them out.î We will get a conservative estimate, $40 billion in from that settlement, we can put a 2 cents per milligram tax on opiods that brings in another 40 billion. Then you can close a hedge fund loophole that brings in $18 billion. And just like every other policy Iíve proposed, and I think New Hampshire voters should care about this, I have showed how Iím going to pay for it. Because I think we have someone in the White House that has told over 15,000 lies. He makes all kinds of promises. The people of New Hampshire and the people of our country deserve better. I will get this done and it is personal for me."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"I can Adam, and let me also say that in 1988 I probably lost a race for Congress, and we only have one Congress person in the whole state, because in 1988 I said that we should ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country. That was 30 years ago. Furthermore, I am very proud that today I have a D- voting record from the NRA. And under my administration it will be the American people doing gun policy, not dictated by the NRA."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"But to answer your question, I come, like New Hampshire, from a very, very rural state. In Vermont until the last two years ago, we had virtually no gun control legislation at all and I represented that perspective. The world has changed. In Vermont and in New Hampshire and all over this country, people are sickened by the mass shootings that we have seen and the gun violence that we have seen. The world has changed and my views have changed, and my view is right now we need universal background checks, we end the gun show loophole, we end the so called straw man provision. We make certain that we end the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country, and we go further. We go further, but at the bottom line is I will not be intimidated by the NRA. Weíre going to run the gun policy that the American people want."
2020-02-07,Biden,"Hereís the deal. The biggest mistake that Bernie made, that Senator Sanders made, he voted to give the gun manufacturers, the only major industry in America, a loophole that does not allow them to be sued for the carnage they are creating. First thing Iíll do as President is work to get rid of that. Itís going to be hard. Think of all the thousands and thousands of people who died. And I might add Bernie, while you were representing your constituency, an awful lot of people [inaudible 00:13:18] your gun state and theyíve come around. In fact, all those folks in California, New York, Pennsylvania, theyíre getting killed by the thousands during the same period."
2020-02-07,Biden,"I come from a state thatís a major gun owning stare. I introduced the first assault weapons ban. I in fact got it passed. Iím the only guy that beat the NRA twice. While I was pushing the Brady Background Bill to check background checks, Bernie voted five times against that when he was in the House. So look, the other thing is that we have to be held accountable for the things we did, Iím the guy that set up drug courts. I set them up. I wrote it into law and it never got funded. And also on opioids, Iím the guy whoís already begun to make a down payment. In the Cures Act I put in $1 billion to fight opioid addiction. And lastly, my time is going to be up, surely. Hereís the deal. Those Chief Executive Officer of drug companies, they should not only be fined, they should go to jail."
2020-02-07,Warren,"Look, we have a gun violence problem in America. It is about the mass shootings that we hear about in our schools and that frighten us, about it in theaters and in churches. Itís also though about shootings that occur on sidewalks and in playgrounds, often in communities of color that are hit hardest, but there are no headlines over those. Itís also about suicide and the increasing lethality of suicide because of the availability of guns. It is also about the increased chances that itís usually a woman will die of domestic violence if she is with a violent man and a gun is in the home."
2020-02-07,Warren,"We need to think of this problem not as one and done or three things and done. We need to think of it just like we did on auto safety. We just keep coming back. We treat it like the public health emergency that it is. But the question we should be asking ourselves is when America, across this country, including gun owners, agree in certain basic things, universal background checks, get assault weapons off the streets. Why can we not even get a vote in the United States Senate?"
2020-02-07,Warren,"And the answer is 90%, think about this, more than 90% of Americans agree on this. We canít get a vote in the United States Senate because it is the gun industry that continues to call the shots. Until we attack the corruption in Washington, the influence of money on campaigns and lobbying, weíre not going to be able to meet our promises. And one more, until we agree that we are willing to roll back to filibuster, the gun industry is going to continue to have a veto and we will never make the changes we make. We have to be willing to build a future that works, not for a gun industry, but that works for the rest of America and protects our children."
2020-02-07,Biden,We ought to be able to sue the gun industry.
2020-02-07,Biden,"If you say the rest of what I said. I said that weíre going to not appoint anyone who did not have a view that unenumerated rights existed in the Constitution. Thatís not a specific test. Itís a generic test. And only way, the only reason women have the right to choose is because itís determined that thereís unenumerated rights coming from the Ninth Amendment in the Constitution. Thatís what I said. And I was part of the reason why Elena Kagan, who worked for me, we got onto the Supreme Court. I was part of the reason why Ruth Bader Ginsburg is on the Court. I was part of the reason why Sotomayer is on the Court and she will swear me in. I presided, and Iím the reason why this right wasnít taken away a long time ago because I almost single handedly made sure that Robert Bork did not get on the Court because he did not think there should be enumerated rights [inaudible 00:18:04]."
2020-02-07,Biden,Letís get that straight.
2020-02-07,Biden,"Yes. Look, hereís the deal. Litmus test on abortion relates to the fundamental value of the Constitution. A woman does have a right to choose. I would in fact, if they rule it to be unconstitutional, I will send to the United States Congress and it will pass, I believe, a bill thatÖ Excuse me, legislates Roe V. Wade adjusted by Casey. Itís a womanís right to do that. Period. And if you call that a litmus test itís a litmus test, but what I was talking about in the past, so no one gets confused here, is if there is noÖ If you read the Constitution very, very narrowly and say there are no unenumerated rights. If the doesnít say it in the Constitution that doesnít exist, you cannot have any of the things I care about, any of the things I care about as a progressive member of the United States Congress at the time, and as Vice President and as a member of society."
2020-02-07,Warren,"Look, Iíve lived in an America in which abortion was illegal and rich women still got abortions and thatís what we have to remember about this. States are heading toward trying to ban abortion outright and the Supreme Court seems headed in exactly that direction as well. If we are going to protect the people of the United States of America and we are going to protect our rights to have dominion over our own bodies, then itís going to mean we canít simply rely on the courts. Three out of every four people in America believe right now that the rule of Roe versus Wade should be the law. That means we should be pushing for a Congressional solution as well. It is time to have a national law to protect the right of a womanís choice."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,Thank you.
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"I would only appoint judges that would respect precedent and one of those key precedents is Roe v. Wade. In addition, you have got to put it into law. Donald Trump, and I think itís really important to take it to him here, when he was running for election, and this is a case I will make on the debate stage against him, he actually said that he wanted to put women in jail. He then dialed it back and said, ìNo, I want to put doctors in jail.î Is it a big surprise then weíre seeing states like Alabama start enacting laws that would criminalize doctors who perform abortions. Itís not. And that is why itís going to be really important when you look at the overwhelming public support for funding Planned Parenthood, for making sure women have access to contraception, to making sure that they have a right to choose, that we make this case strongly and loudly."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"Well, if all we did was change the number of justices than I agree with her that that could be the consequence. What Iíve called for is not only reforming the number of justices on the bench, but structural reform so that some of the justices are not appointed through a partisan process. We cannot allow the Supreme Court to continue to become one more political battlefield as we are seeing today. And the time has come for us to think bigger, not just reforming the makeup of the court as America, by the way, has done several times in our history. But also remember that the founders gave us the power to amend the Constitution for a reason and we shouldnít be afraid to use it."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"Itís not something you do lightly or quickly, but when it comes to something like Citizens United, which holds that corporations have the same political soul as people and that spending money to influence an election is the same thing as writing an op-ed to your local paper, we need a Constitutional amendment to clear that up and protect our democracy."
2020-02-07,Biden,"I agree with Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Thatís who I agree with. And I agree the way you deal with Citizens United is pass a constitutional amendment I introduced 25 years ago saying that only public money can be spent in elections. Period. Not private money, not billionaires, not money from special interests. Period. Thatís the way to amend the Constitution to deal with that. In addition to that, if in factÖ Look, the Democrats stood up against the man Iíve revered, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he wanted to expand the Court. But they were wise enough to understand that whoever then has the majority will have the ability to abuse it and it will lose its legitimacy and there are three equal branches of government. It says the President shell nominate, the Senate shall dispose, the Senate shall make that decision, not the president. He can nominate."
2020-02-07,Biden,"Thatís why itís so important we must win back the United States Senate this time out. And thatís why as you all look at it up here in New Hampshire and around the world, excuse me, around the country, you have to ask yourself, who is most likely to help get a Senator elected in North Carolina, Georgia? Who can win Florida, Pennsylvania, Minnesota? Who can do that? Because you got to be able to win thoseÖ Well, you can. I agree. But hereís the point. Youíve got to be able to, youíve got to be able to not just win, youíve got to bring along a United States Senate or this becomes moot."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"Look, you asked the simple question, is there a litmus test for those of us up here? For me there is. I will never nominate any person to the Supreme Court or the federal courts in general who was not 100% pro Roe v. Wade. Number two, we have got a codify Roe v. Wade into legislation. Number three, we have to significantly expand funding for Planned Parenthood."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"Sure theyíve been cheating. Look, what we saw Mitch McConnell do, not just in the Supreme Court with Merrick Garland, but across the board with federal judges, was refuse to allow President Obamaís picks to be considered. Thatís why Mr. Trump has appointed so many federal judges, because in fact the Republicans refused to allow President Obama to get his due, and honestly, weíre sitting here talking about do you have a litmus test? We all have the litmus test. Everybody on this row feels exactly the same way about a womanís right to choose. Everybody on this row feels exactly the same way on gun control. Every single one in this row feels the same way."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"Thereís something else going on. These Republicans are in control. Theyíre stacking the Court for a generation with young right-wing radicals, and weíve watched it happen and the question is what are we going to do about it? Thatís where we are in the United States, and the question isÖ Actually Joe Bidenís right. We have to go win a huge victory this year, and weíre in trouble. And so the question is going to be, look at these people, who can pull together the Democratic Party?"
2020-02-07,Steyer,"And let me say this, we have not said one word tonight about race. Not one word. Are you kidding me? We have the most diverse party. We have a very diverse country. We have a very diverse party. The heart and soul of this party is diversity, black people, Latinos, AAPI people, Native Americans and white people. But for goodness sakes, pull it together. Weíre talking about something different. The question we have is how are we getting that diverse group of people to the polls? What are we saying? Everybody on this stage feels the same way about a womanís right to choose and economic justice. The question is how do we beat Trump? How do we take down these Republicans? And the answer is weíve got to show we can take them down on growth, job creation, the economy. We send them packing and then we get all of this including beating the corporations."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"Well, the reality is, on my watch, drug arrests in South Bend were lower than the national average, and specifically to marijuana, lower than in Indiana. But there is no question that systemic racism has penetrated to every level of our system, and my city was not immune. I took a lot of heat for discussing systemic racism with my own police department, but weíve got to confront the fact that there is no escaping how this is part of all of our policies."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"Earlier, we were talking about opioids, and thankfully, America has come to a better understanding about the fact that opioid addiction is best understood as a medical problem. But there were a lot of people, including a lot of African American activists in my community who have made the very good point, itís great that everybodyís so enlightened about drug policy now when it comes to opioids, but where were you when it came to marijuana, where were you when it came to the crack epidemic in the 1990s? That is one of the reasons why I am calling for us as a country to take up those reforms that end incarceration as a response to possession and make sure that we legalize marijuana and when we do it, do it retroactively with expungements to correct the harm done in so many cases of incarceration, disproportionately of black and brown Americans where the incarceration did far more harm than the offense it was intended to deal with."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"And again, the overall rate was lower than the national rate."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"And one of the strategies that our community adopted was to target, when there were cases where there was gun violence and gang violence, which was slaughtering so many in our community, burying teenagers, disproportionately black teenagers, we adopted a strategy that said that drug enforcement would be targeted in cases where there was a connection to the most violent group or gang connected to a murder."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"These things are all connected, but thatís the point. So are all of the things that need to change in order for us to prevent violence and remove the effects of systemic racism, not just from criminal justice, but from our economy, from health, from housing, and from our democracy itself."
2020-02-07,Warren,"No. You have to own up to the fact, and itís important to own up to the facts about how race has totally permeated our criminal justice system. For the exact same crimes, study after study now shows that African Americans are more likely than whites to be detained, to be arrested, to be taken to trial, to be wrongfully convicted, and receive harsher sentences. We need to rework our criminal justice system, from the very front end on what we make illegal all the way through the system, and how we help people come back into the community."
2020-02-07,Warren,"But we cannot just say that criminal justice is the only time we want to talk about race specifically. We need to start having race-conscious laws. Housing, for example, I have a great housing plan to build more housing in America, but understand it was the policy of the United States of America to discriminate against African Americans and any other people of color for buying homes until 1965. You canít just repeal that and say ìOkay, now everything is even.î Itís not. We need race-conscious laws in education and employment, in entrepreneurship, to make this country a country of opportunity for everyone, no matter the color of their skin."
2020-02-07,Yang,"Elizabeth, with respect, you canít regulate away racism with a whole patchwork of laws that are race-specific. What we have to do is heed the writings of Martin Luther King, whose birthday we just celebrated. He said that capitalism forgets that life is social, and what he was championing was a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans of $1000 a month or more that would end up reshaping our economy in communities of color, make it so that black net work is not 10% of white net worth in this country, which is the most important number of them all. We canít regulate that away through any other means except by putting money directly into the hands of African Americans and Latinos and people of color to allow businesses to actually flourish and grow in those communities. The only way that will happen is if black and Latino consumers have buying power, and that is where we have to move as a country."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"Let me say this, I disagree. Andrew, no, let me say this. I disagree with you Andrew. I am the person on this stage who will say openly, Iím for reparations. Something wrong happened. I am for reparations to African Americans in this country, and anyone who things that racism is a thing of the past and not an ongoing problem is not dealing with reality. In fact, three days ago, one of the leaders of Joe Bidenís South Carolina campaign made racist remarks about someone associated with our campaign, and the Legislative Black Caucus went out en masse to stand up for that man and for our campaign. Joe, Iím asking you to come with me and the Legislative Black Caucus and disavow Dick Harpootlian and what he had to say. It was wrong, and Iím asking you to join us. Be on the right side."
2020-02-07,Biden,"Iím asking you to join me and join in the support I have from the overwhelming number of the members of that Black Caucus. I have more support in South Carolina in the Black Caucus and the black community than anybody else. Double what you have, or anybody else here."
2020-02-07,Sanders,I donít think thatís quite right.
2020-02-07,Steyer,"But wait a second, wait a second. Bernie."
2020-02-07,Biden,"Well, that is quite right."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"Letís not argue about polls. Bernie, this isnít about polls."
2020-02-07,Biden,This is not about polls. Iím not talking about polls.
2020-02-07,Sanders,"Let me just say, first of all, we have nine members of the Black Caucus in South Carolina supporting us, but more importantly, much of what Elizabeth said is absolutely correct. We have a racist society from top to bottom impacting healthcare, housing, criminal justice, education, you name it. And clearly this is an issue that must be dealt with. But in terms of criminal justice, what we have got to do is understand the system is broken, is racist. We invested our young people in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration. We end the war on drugs, which has disproportionately impacted African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans. We end private prisons and detention centers in America."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"Bernie, I appreciate what youíre saying."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"And, excuse me, we also, most people donít know this. Tonight in America, 200,000 people are in jail without having been convicted of anything."
2020-02-07,Steyer,Thatís right.
2020-02-07,Sanders,"200,000 people, because they canít afford the $500 for bail they need to get out of jail. That is outrageous, weíre going to end cash bail in America."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"Okay, let me say this. Iíve worked, Bernie, Iíve worked to end cash bail in California and itís gone. Iíve worked to end private prisons in California and theyíre gone. Iím somebody whoís, our family, my wife and I started a bank specifically to support businesses owned by women, black people, and Latinos, because they couldnít get financing anywhere else. But I, Joe, I want a answer. Really. I think you should come over and disavow the statements that this man made that were openly racist, that were wrong, and the Legislative Black Caucus is against. Iím asking you to join us and do the right thing."
2020-02-07,Biden,"Iíve already spoken to Dick Harpootlian and he in fact is, I believe, sorry for what he said. But hereís the deal, folks. Weíve got to stop taking the black community for granted. Thatís the starting place. Every one of the things we talked about here, for example, in South Carolina, Jim Clyburn, he has a program, 10-15-30. We should be investing our money in those communities that havenít gotten help for a long time and give most of that help to those communities. Make it a priority. We should make sure that we have no one going to jail for a drug offense, they go directly, mandatory prison. I mean, excuse me, mandatory treatment, not prison. And we fund it. And we fund it, and three days doesnít get it. It takes at least 60 to 90 days to make any progress. We have to pay for that."
2020-02-07,Biden,"Just like instead of building new prisons, we build new rehabilitation centers. We have to make sure that we have a window at the Treasury Department that allows entrepreneurs who are black and brown and minorities to be able to get loans to be able to start businesses. You know, if you own a house, I know you do know, if you own a house in an all black neighborhood, same exact house in all white neighborhood, exact same shape, the house valued in the black neighborhood would be valued as worth less, making it difficult for you to accumulate wealth, as my friend at the end of the line here says. So hereís the deal: we have to do much, much more. Thatís what got me involved in politics in the first place, redlining, to stop it."
2020-02-07,Biden,"I got involved through the Civil Rights Movement, I became a public defender. Thatís why I got involved. Thereís so many things we have to do across the board, and in education, at-risk schools. We should triple the funding we have for at-risk schools to provide for three, four, and five years old to go to school, not daycare. Increase the salaries of teachers, encourage more blacks to get into teaching, especially black men, because studies show when thereís a black man in a school, it increases prospects significantly, and so on. Thereís a lot we can do, Iíve laid it all out as how to do, go to joebiden.com, youíll see the whole deal, including criminal justice reform."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"Well, I think what Senator Turner was talking about are some of the early actions of Vice President Biden, but no. Joe Biden is a friend of mine, and Iím not here to attack him. But what I would say is that what we need in terms of the African American community is to understand that we have got to start investing big time in education, in healthcare. There is no excuse why white families in America have 10 times more wealth than black families. No excuse that disproportionately, African Americans are in jail compared to whites. No excuse for black women dying in childbirth three times the rate that white women are doing as well."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,Yes.
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"Yes I did, because I think in addition to the economic argument weíre making here with the sad, sad stories of a woman walking into a maternity room in New Orleans and saying her hand are swollen and walking out without her baby, and 30% of African American kids being living in poverty, we know that there are economic solutions here, to invest in those communities, housing, childcare. But thereís something else insidious going on that we havenít addressed, and that is the systematic racism when it comes to voting. That is, moves across the country to limit peopleís right to vote, and that is why I have been leading on these bills to automatically register every kid to vote in this country when they turn 18. There is no reason that we canít do that across this country. To stop the gerrymandering by setting up independent commissions in every single state, and yes, to stop the voting purges."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"Because what is going on right now in the words of one North Carolina court is that they are discriminating with surgical precision against African American voters, and we are not going to be able to get any of these things done if we donít give people the right to vote."
2020-02-07,Biden,I beg your pardon?
2020-02-07,Biden,"Yes, I agree completely. There should be registration, automatic registration, turning 18, you get a driverís license, whatever you do, you automatically are registered, number one. Number two, with regard to what weíre going to see in South Carolina, weíre all going to be there pretty soon. Weíll see whether or not it works. In response to the letter that the person, Iím not saying Bernie wrote the letter, but the senator who wrote the letter was very brisk and significant with other African Americans in South Carolina taking issue with her."
2020-02-07,Biden,"But look, Amy is right, the senatorís correct. That is that we, in fact, there is systematic racism, and thatís why our Justice Department works so hard to go after those. You know, realize there are 35 states in the United States of America that have come up with a total of 78 laws to restrict voting just in the last five years to try to keep African Americans from voting, and brown as well, black and brown people from voting. And that will be an enormous priority in my administration as it was in ours. Itís just wrong, simply wrong."
2020-02-07,Warren,"Iím glad to stand on this stage with my fellow Democrats who talk about how important the black community is, at least at election time. Year after year after year, election after election after election, Democrats go to people in the black community and say ìBoy, we really care about these issues. Racism is terrible, we all want to do something,î and then somehow the problem just seems to keep getting worse. Well I think itís time we have real, concrete plans that are going to make a difference in peopleís lives. I proposed a two cent wealth tax. And let me tell you just one of the things we can do with a two cent wealth tax. We can cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans, and because African Americans have to borrow more money to go to college, borrow more money while theyíre in college and have a harder time paying it back when they get out, that one law is going to help close the black-white wealth gap for people with student loans by about 20 points."
2020-02-07,Warren,"We arenít making a difference in America. Weíre saying to the rich folks ìYou keep your money, and the rest of us will talk about racism but not really do anything.î I think the time for that is over, Iím ready to get in this fight and really make a change."
2020-02-07,Biden,"Okay, thank you."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"Out of narrative comes policy. And weíre talking about a lot of policies that affect Americans, broadly and disproportionately affect black Americans or brown Americans. But what I believe is we should set up a commission on race and deal with race explicitly. Because everyoneís saying we canít have rules that are different for different people, but in fact weíre here because we had rules that are different for different people. I would set up a formal commission on race on day one to retell the story of the last 400 years in America of systematic racism against African Americans, not just legal discrimination, injustice, and cruelty, but also the contribution that the African American community has made to America in building it and in leading the entire country from a moral standpoint for generations and centuries. Because I believe out of narrative comes policy. We need to repair damage thatís been done officially, and pretending weíre all the same is not accurate. We got here a certain way. Letís talk about Jim Crow, letís talk about Martin Luther King, letís talk about Barbara Lee, the congresswoman from Oakland whoís one of our great leaders, and then letís figure out how to repair the damage so we can move forward together."
2020-02-07,Yang,"The median African American household net work is projected to be zero by 2053. Things are not getting better for people of color. If anything, theyíre getting wore, because weíre in the process of eliminating the most common jobs in our economy. Itís something of an economic unnatural disaster, and who suffers most in a natural disaster? People of color, people with lower levels of capital and access to opportunity and education."
2020-02-07,Yang,"And while I know we love to champion education here as Democrats, only 33% of Americans are going attend college, lower percentage of African Americans. There is no way we can prevent this tsunami from wiping out African American net worth unless we put straight cash into their hands sometime between now and 2053, and itís not just them, it is truck drivers, it is retail clerks, it is call center workers, it is accountants, it is bookkeepers. We are in the midst of the greatest economic transformation in the history of our country, and itís going to hit black people the hardest. We have to stop nibbling at the edges and actually start solving the real problem."
2020-02-07,Warren,"Look, I donít think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the United States. I donít think any billionaire ought to be able to do it, and I donít think people who suck up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns out to do it. I heard everyone here talking about as Democrats, we all want to overturn Citizens United because we want to end this unlimited spending, yeah. Except everyone on this stage except Amy and me is either a billionaire or is receiving help from PACs that can do unlimited spending. So if you really want to live where you say, then put your money where your mouth is and say no to the PACs."
2020-02-07,Warren,"Look, I think the way we build a democracy going forward is not billionaires reaching in their own pockets or people sucking up to billionaires. The way we build it going forward is we have a grassroots movement funded from the grassroots up. Thatís the way Iím running this campaign. If you think itís the right way to run a campaign, to go elizabethwarren.com and pitch in $5, because understand this: our democracy hangs in the balance. If we have to fund through billionaires, then weíre just going to be an America thatís going to work better and better for billionaires and not for anyone else."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"So I canít stand the big money in politics, and one of my major focuses is going to be on passing that constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. I didnít come from money, and I just simply think people donít look at the guy in the White House and say ìCan we get someone richer?î I donít think they think that. They want to have someone that they can understand. And you know my background. My grandpa was an iron ore miner, he worked 1500 feet underground in the mines his whole life. He couldnít even graduate from high school because he had to raise his nine brothers and sisters. My grandpa saved money in a coffee can to send my dad to a two year community college. That was my familyís trust, and you canít send, like Donald Trump got from his family, you canít fit $413 million in a coffee can."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"My mom grew up and wanted to be a teacher in Wisconsin. She moved to Minnesota, she taught second grade until she was 70 years old. And no, I am not a billionaire, but I stand before you today as granddaughter of an iron ore miner, the daughter of a teacher and a newspaperman, the first woman elected to the US Senate from the state of Minnesota, someone who has passed over 100 bills as a lead Democrat in that gridlock in Washington, DC, and that is because we live in a country of shared dreams. And that means no matter where you come from, no matter where you come from, you should be able to make it. So please help me in my efforts at amyklobuchar.com."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,This is a campaign of real people.
2020-02-07,Sanders,"Letís talk about money, and letís talk about-"
2020-02-07,Sanders,"Ö Iíve got to answer before the question, itís more Ö"
2020-02-07,Sanders,I couldnít hear that.
2020-02-07,Sanders,"Well, itís a funny thing. There are millions of people who can desire to run for office, but I guess if youíre work $60 billion and you can spend several hundred million dollars on commercials, you have a slight advantage. That is nonsense. What we have got to do is have a nation in which we not only overturn Citizens United, we move to public funding of election."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"In terms of money in politics, our campaign, and I am enormously proud of this, unlike some of the folks up here, I donít have 40 billionaires, Pete, contributing to my campaign, coming from the pharmaceutical industry, coming from Wall Street, and all the big money interests. What we do have is we have now over six million contributions from one and a half million people averaging $18.50 a contribution. That is unprecedented in the history of American politics. If we want to change America, youíre not going to do it be electing candidates who are going out to rich peopleís homes begging for money. The way weíre going to do it is build a mass movement of working people who are prepared to stand up, not take money from these billionaires, not take money from Wall Street, but stand up to the drug companies and Wall Street. And if you want to be part of that political revolution, berniesanders.com."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"We are going into the fight of our lives. Donald Trump, according to news reports, and his allies raised $25 million today. We need to go into that fight with everything that weíve got. Now Iíve been very clear on both my record, where I have sued pharmaceutical companies, and what Iím campaigning for, that includes raising wages and raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. And as the only person on this stage who is not a millionaire or a billionaire, I know a thing or two about building a movement because mayor of South Bend, Indiana is not exactly an establishment fundraising powerhouse."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"We are here without the involvement of any corporate PACs because hundreds of thousands of people went to, yes, peteforamerica.com, contributed to this campaign, and let me say something else. If we want to bring about any of the changes that everyone is talking about so elegantly up here, we need to put together the majority that can decisively defeat Donald Trump. And in order to do that, we need a politics that is defined not by who we reject, but how we bring everybody into the fold. And if you are low-income, or if youíre able to contribute a lot. If youíve always voted Democrat, or if youíre an Independent or even a Republican whoís just sick of looking your kids in the eye and trying to explain this White House, we need you to join us right now. I will not pursue politics by telling people they canít be at our side if theyíre not with us 100% of the time. This is a time for addition, not rejection, for belonging, not exclusion."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"Yes. I mean, itís a disagreement, but if you look at every environmental group in this country, including the Sunrise organization, weíre so proud to have their support, because we have introduced the most comprehensive climate change proposal I think ever authored by a presidential candidate. But they are saying, what the environmental groups are saying, weíre simply exporting fossil fuel emissions to Mexico. There is not one word in that trade agreement Ö"
2020-02-07,Sanders,"There is not one word in that trade agreement that deals with climate change and I donít know how in 2020 you can do that. Second of all, there is, in terms of outsourcing of jobs, a major crisis in this country. Nobody believes that under this Trump trade agreement that they will not be continued and significant outsourcing of jobs into low wage Mexico, where workers are paid in some cases less than $2 an hour. So I think the right vote was the vote against that agreement. I donít apologize for that."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"Well, first of all, I want to defend the honor of the incredible two senators from New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, who work so hard for this state every day and I voted with them. Why did I vote with them? Because there were some major improvements in this trade agreement when it comes to labor inspections, when it comes to getting rid of a sweetheart pharma deal that was in place and when it comes to climate change, I think we have to have a North American trading block. We have to have Mexico and Canada and America working together and the best way to take on climate change as president, yes, Iíll work to make this a part of every future trade agreement, but the best way to take on climate change is by getting back into the international climate change agreement, which I will do on day one."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"It is bringing back the clean power rules. It is bringing back the gas mileage standards and it is introducing sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and you cannot divorce trade from that, and in future trade agreements, that should be part of our negotiations. But Iím telling you right now, having no trade agreement with Canada and Mexico puts us at such a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with China and pushing China to do better when it comes to climate change."
2020-02-07,Warren,"Yes I did, and Iíll tell you why, because there are a lot of farmers around this country that are really hurting because of Donald Trumpís trade policies. There are a lot of workers who are hurting because they canít get enforcement of any workersí rights. So this NAFTA provision, after a lot of negotiation with Democrats, Senator Sherrod Brown helped make it a whole lot better. This makes things somewhat better for workers and for farmers and when I see a law that makes things somewhat better for hardworking people in this country, Iím saying, Iíll sign up for that and then Iíll get up tomorrow morning and Iíll start working hard for a better trade deal on climate, a better trade deal that has a basic coherence to it. Everyone wants to get to the American market. We should be raising standards on climate around the world to get access to our market."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"Yeah, I got to agree with Bernie Sanders, I do. Senator Warren is right. Everybody wants to get into our market, and thatís how we convince them that theyíve got to be right on climate too. That we have to stop making foreign policy decisions in the old way. Yeah, of course, we want to make things better for American workers, and itís absolutely critical that when we think about trade policy, weíre thinking about it from the point of view of the American people, not of the American corporations. Thatís a huge positive change. And I agree with the senators on that, but thereís something else going on here when we think about our foreign policy. We talked about whether it was right to kill General Soleimani, and there was no discussion in that about where that leaves the United States in the community of nations around the world."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"So if we actually want to be the leaders of the world, the leaders of the free world who can actually negotiate a climate treaty around the world that sticks, that makes a difference, weíre going to have to put climate first, and when we think about doing the wrong thing, the way Mr. Trump did with General Soleimani, we have to ask, does that help us build a coalition of countries around the world to do the right thing? It absolutely does not."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"Being all by ourselves, being the Empire in the Star Wars movie does not put us in a position to get done what we need to get done as the leader of the free world. So in fact, the USMCA is something, thatís the first step, but the second step is exactly what Bernie Sanders is saying. Use access to our market as a negotiating thing to make sure not only that we represent American workers, but that we represent the American people in the long run and we make sure that we get a safe climate deal."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"One of the things about being in the arena is you have to make decisions all the time and these things arenít always exactly how you would do them. But in this case, if you want to criticize Trump for not ever having any friends, and I would agree, he always sides with tyrants over innocents. He always sides with dictators over allies, but I think youíve got to have some friends and those two countries, our neighbors, may not be perfect, but they are our friends, and we have a president that literally blames everyone in the world, and we have not talked about this enough."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"He blames Barack Obama for everything that goes wrong. He blames his federal reserve chair that he appointed himself. He blames the King of Denmark, who does that? He blames the prime minister of Canada for, he claims, cutting him out of the Canadian version of Home Alone 2, who does that? Thatís what Donald Trump does. So my point here is that when we have opportunities to work with our allies, and New Hampshire is such a great example of this, New Hampshire, Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, with senators like Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassen, who believe we need to work with NATO and the rest of the world who sees it as a smaller state, but a state that is a piece of the world. We cannot be alone, and that trade agreement was not perfect, but the point of it is, if we start isolating ourselves from the rest of the world, we are going to hurt ourselves economically and we are going to hurt our nationís security."
2020-02-07,Yang,"George, weíre in the midst of the most extreme winner take all economy in the history of our country, and unfortunately, that extremity is just going to reach unprecedented heights as technology is getting stronger, smarter, more capable all the time, and most of us are not. Most adults feel happy if we stayed about the same on any given day. So if we want to alleviate child poverty, we need to put money directly into the hands of families, particularly single parents, 40% of American children today are born to single moms, 90% of single parents are single moms and right now we have fallen into this trap where we have allowed the market to tell us what we are all worth."
2020-02-07,Yang,"What is the market value my wife, Evelyn had, or stay at home parents around the country? Zero. Caregivers taking care of ailing loved ones, like Kyle Christensen in Iowa? Zero. Volunteers and activists in our communities trying to do something positive? Zero. Coaches and mentors helping our kids? Zero. Most artists, sorry artists, but itís true. Zero. Increasingly local journalists, which is wiping out our ability to have a functioning democracy because you canít vote on something if you actually donít have any news coverage. The mission in this campaign has to be for us to disentangle economic value and human value, say they are not the same things and make this case to our fellow Americans. That we each have intrinsic value as citizens, as human beings and as owners and shareholders of the richest country in the history of the world."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"The problem is, Americaís been counting the wrong things. Now we have a president who says the economy is fantastic because the Dow Jones is looking good. Iím sure if youíve got a building with your name on it close to Wall Street, then that really is the same thing as the economy to you. But the problem is, weíve had an economy grow and not be able to lift up those most in need, or even so many in the middle."
2020-02-07,Buttigieg,"When Iím president, weíre going to measure the performance of our economy, not by the Dow Jones but by the income growth of the 90%, because a good economy is one where children are being lifted out of poverty. Just as we focused in South B on cutting the poverty rate, in particular, the black poverty rate and making sure families with children were participating in the growth that we did have. This is one more example of something where the American people want to see change. The American people, not just die hard Democrats, but so many Independents and some Republicans, think we need to prioritize economic equity and yet it still doesnít happen. That is why we need to recognize that the time has arrived for a different kind of politics. To turn the page, leave the politics of the past in the past and deliver a better future before it is too late."
2020-02-07,Warren,"So I started my grownup life as a special education teacher. I learned early on about the worth of every single human being, and I believe that the best investment we can make as a nation, the best investment we can make as human beings, is to invest in our children. Weíve had enough of making rhetoric around this. Everyone says they love the kids, but hereís the deal. Itís time to come up with real plans to make that happen. Iíve talked before about a two cent wealth tax, but the whole idea behind it is we can do early childhood education and good quality child care, universal pre-K for every three year old and four year old in America, and we can stop exploiting the people, largely black and brown women who do this work and raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America."
2020-02-07,Warren,"We want to have a real future in this country, then invest in our children. Donít leave public education just to our localities in our states. Be a good federal partner. Put real money into our schools, put real money into housing, put real money into into healthcare. Put real money into the future of our children. Thatís how we build the America of our best values."
2020-02-07,Biden,"I come from a family where our dad walked in one day and said, weíve got to move. Donít have a job. Weíve got to move to a different city. I watched my dad and I met many people here in this state and others, who go through the same thing where the fatherís made that longest walk or the motherís made that longest walk. I was listed for the entire time I was in the United States Congress as the poorest man in the United States Congress. My net worth was net zero a couple of times. The fact of the matter is that Iíve never focused on money for me and I was a single dad for five years. Itís not as hard as being a single mom and I had help from my sisters in the audience and others, but the fact is that I think we have to focus on what is at stake here."
2020-02-07,Biden,"These arenít someone elseís children. Theyíre all our children. Theyíre the kite strings that lift our national ambitions, they really are. They lift our national ambitions aloft. We have an overwhelming interest, overwhelming interest in seeing to it they do well. You know, 24 out of every 100 students in school today, from grade school to high school, are Latino. What are we going to do? Walk away from that?"
2020-02-07,Biden,"Many of them come from homes that are poor, very poor. Thatís why I invest so much time and energy in preschool. Thatís why if I only have $1 to spend, I spend it equipping the child before they get into school in the early day, than after and we talk about all those kids out there that are going to be graduating. A great number of them, as Mr. Yang said, arenít going on to college, although I think we should help with college. Theyíre not going on to college. What theyíre going to do, theyíre going to be equipped to compete in the 21st century by training them for the new trades, the new opportunities, the new capabilities that are out there. We must focus on our children. Like I said, theyíre all our children, theyíre not somebody elseís kids. Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, as my father would say, is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect and weíre not doing it."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"Well, the answer to your question of why we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth, disproportionately high for the African American community, by the way, is the same reason that we give massive trillion dollar tax breaks to the rich and large corporations. Same reason that we give tens of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry, while half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. The same reason that we have three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of America."
2020-02-07,Sanders,"The same reason that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right. Same reason as to why we are paying in some cases 10 times more than other countries for prescription drugs, and that reason is that our priorities are determined by the 1% and by wealthy campaign contributors. Our priorities are determined by those who want to see the rich get richer and are turning their backs on the working families of this country. What is unique about our campaign, is we say, unashamedly, we are raising our campaign contributions, not from billionaires but from working class people. That our campaign is about the working families of this country for the working class of this country and that is the administration that we will run. It is time to take on the big money interests. It is time to change our national priorities. Thank you."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"In Cokieís memory, let me answer this question. We may have lost an election in 2016, Democrats, but we did not lose hope. And there is a way, itís actually based on a National Academy of Science report and Iíve used that to put together a plan to reduce child poverty in half in 10 years and eradicate it in a generation. We can do it with investment in childcare. We can do it with investment in preschool and school and we can do it with tax credits and we can get it done. But to get it done, we have to be able to reach those voters that we lost in this state and across the country."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"Thereís an old story of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and when he died, his body was put on a train and went up across America and there was a guy standing by those tracks along with so many Americans, and he had his hat on his chest and he was sobbing and a reporter said, Sir, did you know the president? And the guy says, no, I didnít know the president, but he knew me. He knew me. I will tell you this, there is a complete lack of empathy in this guy in the White House right now. I will bring that to you."
2020-02-07,Klobuchar,"If you have trouble stretching your paycheck to pay for that rent. I know you and I will fight for you. If you have trouble deciding if youíre going to pay for your childcare or your longterm care, I know you and I will fight for you. If you have trouble figuring out if youíre going to fill your refrigerator or fill your prescription drug, I know you and I will fight for you. I do not have the biggest name up on this stage. I donít have the biggest bank account. Iím not a political newcomer with no record, but I have a record of fighting for people. Iím asking you to join us@amyklobuchar.com. Iím asking you to believe that someone who totally believes in America can win this because if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me, Please, New Hampshire, I would love your vote and I would love the vote of America. Thank you."
2020-02-07,Steyer,"The Republicans have a cruel plan and their plan is pretty simple. Itís to cut taxes on the richest Americans and the biggest corporations and then they pay for it by cutting education for kids, by cutting healthcare across the board, by allowing corporations to pollute as much as they want, and then they try and break unions and the organized labor movement. Itís very simple. Thatís what Mr. Trumpís plan is and itís true in every single red state, but we are not going to win by just criticizing Mr. Trump. I know that there is a better America out there and that America lives in our hearts and minds. And that America understands that when a kid succeeds in Columbia, South Carolina, that is a triumph for every American. And the same is true of a kid in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mr. Trump has no idea what prosperity looks like across this country. Itís not just that he does bad things. He doesnít understand that investing in education and healthcare and good union jobs is actually an investment in our common humanity and in growth in the future, mobility and justice. That is the America that lives in our hearts and minds that will beat Mr. Trump, because he will never be able to imagine it. So in fact, what we need to do is have a new conception, a new dream of America, dream it and make it happen. Imagine the mountain and then we climb it together. We are in perilous times. I am asking for your vote. Letís rise together."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"When the Congress was debating whether or not we go into a war in Iraq, invade Iraq, I got up on the floor of the House and I said that would be a disaster, it would lead to unprecedented levels of chaos in the region. And Iíd not only voted against the wall, I help lead the effort against that wall. Just last year, I helped for the first time in the modern history of this country, pass a War Powers Act Resolution, working with a conservative Republican, Mike Lee of Utah, which said that the war in Yemen, led by Saudi Arabia was unconstitutional because Congress had not authorized it."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"We got a majority vote in the Senate. We got a majority vote in the House. Unfortunately, Bush vetoed that and that horrific war continues. I am able to work with Republicans. I am able to bring people together, to try to create a world where we solve conflicts over the negotiating table, not through military efforts."
2020-01-14,Biden,"I said 13 years ago, it was a mistake to give the President the authority to go to war, if in fact he couldnít get inspectors into Iraq to stop what thought to be the attempt to get a nuclear weapon. It was a mistake and I acknowledged that. But the man who also argued against that war, Barack Obama picked me to be his Vice President and once we were elected President, and Vice President, he turned to me and asked me to end that war. I know what itís like to send a son or daughter and like our colleague has gone to war in Afghanistan, my son for a year in Iraq and thatís why I do it very, very reluctantly."
2020-01-14,Biden,"Thatís why I led the effort as you know, Wolf against surging tens of thousands of troops into Afghanistan. We should not send anyone anywhere unless the overwhelming vital interest of United States are at stake. They were not at stake there. They were not at stake in Iraq and it was a mistaken vote. But I think my record overall on every other thing weíve done has beenÖ Iím prepared to compare it to anybodyís on this stage."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Well, itís a little bit of a difference on that particular vote, every single member of the House, including myself voted for it, only Barbara Lee voted against it. But what I understood from right away in terms of the war in Iraq, the difference here is that the war in Iraq turned out to be the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country. As Joe well knows, we lost 4,500 brave troops, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"We have spent trillions of dollars on that endless war, money which should go into healthcare and education and infrastructure in this country. Joe and I listened to what Dick Cheney and George Bush and Rumsfeld had to say. I thought they were lying. I didnít believe them for a moment, I took to the floor I did everything I could to prevent that war. Joe saw it differently."
2020-01-14,Biden,"I was asked to bring 156,000 troops home from that war, which I did. I led that effort. It was a mistake to trust that they werenít going to go to war. They said they were not going to go to war. They said they were just going to get inspectors in. The world, in fact voted to send inspectors in and they still went to war. From that point on, I was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake and from that point on, I moved to bring those troops home."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"Thank you Wolf, and Iíve been very clear that I respect the mayorís experience very much in the military. I just have different experience. Iíve been in the US Senate for over 12 years and I think what you want in a President is someone who has dealt with these life and death issues and who has made decisions. I will look at my position on the Iraq war first. I wasnít in the Senate for that vote, but I opposed that war from the very beginning. In my first campaign for Senate, I ran against a Republican who ran ads against me on it, but I stood my ground. When I got to the Senate, I pushed to bring our troops home."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"Then I have dealt with every issue from Afghanistan, to keeping our troops with good healthcare, after what we saw with Walter Reed and being part of an effort to improve the situation for our troops in a very big way with their education and with their jobs and also with their healthcare. I think right now what we should be talking about though, Wolfe, is what is happening right now with Donald Trump. Donald Trump is taking us pell-mell toward another war. We have a very important resolution."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"We just found out today the four Republicans are joining Democrats to go to him and say, ìYou must have an authorization of military force if youíre going to go to war with Iran.î That is so important because we have a situation where he got us out of the Iranian nuclear agreement, something I on for a significant period of time. As President, I will get us back into that agreement. I will take an oath to protect and defend our constitution and I will mean it."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"Well, I bring a different perspective. There are enlisted people that I served with, barely old enough to remember those votes on the authorization after 9-11, on the war in Iraq, and there are people now old enough to enlist who were not alive for some of those debates. The next President is going to be confronted with national security challenges, different in scope and in kind from anything weíve seen before."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"Not just conventional military challenges, not just stateless terrorism, but cybersecurity challenges, climate security challenges, foreign interference in our elections. Itís going to take a view to the future, as well as the readiness, to learn from the lessons of the past and for me, those lessons of the past are personal."
2020-01-14,Warren,"I believe the principal job of the Commander in Chief is to keep America safe and I think thatís about judgment. I think it starts with knowing our military. I sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I work with our generals, with our military leaders, with our intelligence, but I also visit our troops. I visit our troops around the world. Iíve been to Afghanistan, to Iraq, to Jordan, to South Korea. Iíve been to lots of places to talk with our troops. And I fight for our troops to make sure that they get their pay, that they get the housing and medical benefits that theyíve been promised, that they donít get cheated by giant financial institutions."
2020-01-14,Warren,"I have three brothers who are in the military and I know how much our military families sacrifice, but I also know that we have to think about our defense in very different ways. We have to think about cyber. We have to think about climate. We also have to think about how we spend money. We have a problem with a revolving door in Washington, between the defense industry and the Department of Defense and the Pentagon. That is corruption, pure and simple. We need to block that revolving door and we need to cut our defense budget. We need to depend on all of our tools, diplomatic, economic, working with our allies and not let the defense industry call the shots."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"I worked internationally around the world for decades. I traveled, I met with governments, I met with business, and I understand how America interacts with other countries. And you asked what is the reason that the experience really counts? And to me, I believe that Senator Warren made a great point. It isnít so much about experience, itís about judgment. If youíve been listening to this, what we are hearing is 20 years of mistakes by the American government in the Middle East, of failure, of mistakes. So the real question is judgment."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"And if you look who had the judgment, it was a State Senator from Illinois with no experience named Barack Obama who opposed the war. It is a Congress woman, Barbara Lee from Oakland, California, who stood up against the original vote, who was the only person in Congress. So I would say to you this, an outside perspective looking at this and actually dealing with the problems as they are is what weíre looking for now. I agree with Senator Warren, we are spending dramatically too much money on defense. The money that weíre spending there, we could spend in the other parts of the budget and itís time for someone from the outside to have a strategic view about what weíre trying to do and how to do it."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Okay, let me tell you, but before I tell you that, let me tell you something else. And that is, and I donít know if my colleagues here will agree with me or not, maybe they will. But what we have to face as a nation is that the two great foreign policy disasters of our lifetimes are the war in Vietnam and the war in Iraq, both of those wars were based on lies. And right now what I fear very much is we have a President who is lying again and could drag us into a war that is even worse than the war in Iraq."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"To answer your question, what we need to do is have an international coalition. We cannot keep acting unilaterally. As you know, the nuclear deal with Iran was worked on with a number of our allies. We have got to undo what Trump did, bring that coalition together and make sure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon."
2020-01-14,Biden,"I was part of that deal to get the nuclear agreement with Iran, bringing together the rest of the world and including some of the folks who arenít friendly to us and it was working. It was working, it was being held tightly. There was no movement on the part of the Iranian government to get closer to a nuclear weapon. And look whatís happened, he went ahead and it was predictable from the day he pulled out of the agreement, Trump, what exactly would happened. Weíre now isolated. Weíre in a situation where our allies in Europe are making a comparison between the United States and Iran, saying both ought to stand down, making a moral equivalence. We have lost our standing in the region, we have lost the support of our allies. The next President has to be able to pull those folks back together, re-establish our alliances and insist that Iran go back into the agreement, which I believe with the pressure applied as we put on before we can get done."
2020-01-14,Biden,"I would leave troops in the Middle East in terms of patrolling the Gulf, where we are now, small numbers of troops. And I think itís a mistake to pull out the small number of troops that are there now to deal with ISIS. Whatís happened is, now that heís gone ahead, the President and started this whole process moving, whatís happening? ISIS is going to reconstitute itself. Weíre in a position where we have to pull our forces out. Americans have to leave the entire region and quite frank, I think heís flat out lied about saying the reason he made the strike was because our embassies were about to be bombed."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"I would leave some troops there, but not in the level that Donald Trump is taking us right now. Afghanistan, I have long wanted to bring our troops home, I would do that. Some would remain for counter terrorism and training. In Syria, I would not have removed 150 troops from the border with Turkey. I think that was a mistake. I think it made our allies and many others much more vulnerable to ISIS. And then when it comes to Iraq, right now I would leave our troops there despite the mess that has been created by Donald Trump."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"At the briefing we had last week, I was the only person on this stage that asked a question of both the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State. And I asked them about imminent threat, but I also ask them what their alternatives were and they gave very vague, vague answers. I asked them where is the surge of diplomacy that we would be seeing if I was President? And I asked them where they were going to leave the Iraqi people? Time and time again, you see that this President puts his own interest, his private interests in front of our countries. I would put our countryís interests first as Commander in Chief."
2020-01-14,Warren,"No, I think we need to get our combat troops out. You know, we have to stop this mindset that we can do everything with combat troops. Our military is the finest military on earth and they will take any sacrifice we ask them to take, but we should stop asking our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily. Our keeping combat troops there is not helping. We need to work with our allies. We need to use our economic tools. We need to use our diplomatic tools."
2020-01-14,Warren,"Now look, I understand there are people on this stage when it comes to Afghanistan, for example, who talk about five more years, 10 more years. Shoot Lindsay Graham talks about leaving troops there for a hundred more years. No one has a solution and an end point. We need to get our combat troops out. They are not helping create more safety for the United States or the region."
2020-01-14,Biden,"Well, Iíll tell you what. Thereís a difference between combat troops and leaving special forces in a position. I was part of the coalition that put together 68 countries to deal with stateless terror, as well as failed States, not us alone, 68 other countries. Thatís how we were able to defeat and end the caliphate for ISIS. Theyíll come back if we do not deal with them and we do not have someone who can bring together the rest of the world to go with us, with small numbers of special forces we have, to organize the effort to take them down."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"If we can continue to remain engaged without having an endless commitment of ground troops. But whatís going on right now is the Presidentís actually sending more. The very President who said he was going to end endless war, who pretended to have been against the war in Iraq all along. But we know thatís not true. Now has more troops going into the Middle East. And whenever I see that happen, I think about the day we shipped out and the time that was set aside for saying goodbye to family members."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"I remember walking with a friend of mine, another Lieutenant I trained with as we walked away and his one and a half year old boy was toddling after him not understanding why his father wasnít turning back to scoop him up. And it took all the strength he had, not to turn around and look at his boy one more time. That is happening by the thousands right now, as we see so many more troops sent into harmís way. And my perspective is to ensure that that will never happen when there is an alternative as Commander in Chief."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Wolf, in America today, our infrastructure is crumbling. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. 87 million people have no healthcare or are under insured. You got 500,000 people sleeping out on the streets tonight. The American people are sick and tired of endless wars, which have cost us trillions of dollars. Our job is to rebuild the United Nations, rebuild the State department, make sure that we have the capability of bringing the world together to resolve international conflict diplomatically and stop the endless wars that we have experienced."
2020-01-14,Biden,"I ran the first time as a 29 year old kid against the war in Vietnam, on the grounds that only way they can take a nation to war, is with the informed consent of the American people. The informed consent of the American people. And with regard to this idea that we can walk away and not have any troops anywhere, excluding special forces, thereís no way you negotiate or been able to negotiate with terrorists. You have to be able to form coalitions, to be able to defeat them or contain them."
2020-01-14,Biden,"If you donít, we end up being the worldís policeman again. Theyíre going to come to us, theyíve come to us before, theyíll come to us again. So thatís a fundamental difference than negotiating with other countries, itís fundamentally a requirement that we use our special forces in small numbers to coordinate with other countries to bring together coalitions."
2020-01-14,Biden,"No, there was the authorization for the use of military force that was passed by the United States Congress House and Senate and signed by the President. That was the authority, does not give authority to go into Iran, it gave authority to deal with these other issues."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,That authorization needs to be replaced.
2020-01-14,Biden,Exactly. We tried that.
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"When we lost troops in [inaudible 00:19:21], there were members of Congress who admitted they didnít even know we had troops there. And it was all pursuant to an authorization that was passed to deal with Al Qaeda and 9-11. And often Congress has been all too happy to leave aside its role. Now thanks to Democrats in Congress, thatís changing. But the reality is year after year, Congress didnít want to touch this either because it was so politically difficult. Fundamental truth is, if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas into harmís way, often on deployment after deployment, then weíve got to make sure that Congress has the courage to take tough up or down votes on whether they ought to be there. And when I am President, anytime, which I hope will never happen, but anytime Iím compelled to use force, I seek that authorization. We will have a three year sunset, so that the American people are included not only in the decision about whether to send troops but whether to continue."
2020-01-14,Warren,"Well imminent threat, but we need an authorization for the use of military force before we take this nation into combat. That is what the constitution provides and thatís what as Commander in Chief, I will do. But I just want to be clear, everyone on this stage talks about nobody wants endless war, but the question is when and how do you plan to get out of it? On Senate Armed Services Committee, we have one general after another in Afghanistan who comes in and says, ìYou know, weíve just turned the corner and now itís all going to be different.î"
2020-01-14,Warren,"And then what happens? Itís all the same for another year. Someone new comes in and weíve just turned the corner. Weíve turned the corners so many times weíre going in circles in these regions. This has got to stop. Itís not enough to say, ìSomeday weíre going to get out.î No one on the ground. None of our military can describe what the conditions are for getting out. Itís time to get our combat troops home."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"I would take military action to protect the lives and safety of American citizens. But what we can see in the Middle East and what this conversation shows, is that there is no real strategy that weíre trying to accomplish in what weíre doing in the Middle East. Obviously Mr. Trump has no strategy. He is going from crisis to crisis from escalation to escalation. But if you look further over the last 20 years including in the war in Afghanistan, we know from the Washington Post that in fact there was no strategy, there was just a series of tactical decisions that made no sense."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"So we really have to ask ourselves in the Middle East, what are we trying to accomplish? I agree with Vice President Biden, to do it we should definitely be doing it in coalition with other countries. And I want to point out that as we do that weíre confronted by this issue which everyone is talking about. But at the same time thereís a gigantic climate issue in Australia, which also requires the same kind of value driven coalition building, that we actually should be using in the Middle East. We need to ask ourselves, how are we going to provide a world that is safer for Americans, where we can prosper more? And every single thing we do should follow into that strategy and itís just not happening in Washington DC."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"Ensuring that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons, will of course be a priority because itís such an important part of keeping America safe. But unfortunately, President Trump has made it much harder for the next President to achieve that goal. By gutting the Iran nuclear deal, one that by the way, the Trump administration itself admitted was working, certified that it was preventing progress toward a nuclear Iran. By gutting that they have made the region more dangerous and set off the chain of events that weíre now dealing with as it escalates even closer to the brink of outright war. Now- [crosstalk 00:23:46] Yes?"
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"In order to get that done, weíve got to work with our partners. The Iran nuclear deal, the technical term for it was the JCPOA, that first letter J stood for joint. We canít do this alone. Even less so now after everything that has happened, which is why it will be so critically important to engage leaders, including a lot of new leaders emerging around the world and ensure that we have the alliances we need to meet what I believe is not just an American goal, but a widely shared goal around the world, to ensure that Iran does not become a nuclear armed country."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"No. Our security depends on ensuring that Iran does not become nuclear. And by the way, weíve got a lot other challenges with nuclear proliferation around the world. Despite this Presidentís coziness with Vladimir Putin, we actually seem to be further away from being able to work with Russia on things like the renewal of START. Weíve got to move toward less, not more nuclear danger, whether it is from States, from stateless potential terrorist actors or anywhere else around the world."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"I would start negotiations again and I wonít take that as a given, given that our European partners are still trying to hold the agreement together. My issue is that because of the actions of Donald Trump, we are in a situation where they are now starting, Iran is starting to enrich uranium again, in violation of the original agreement. So what I would do is negotiate, I would bring people together just as President Obama did years ago, and I think that we can get this done. But you have to have a President that sees this as a number one goal. And an answer to the original question you asked the mayor, I would not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. And then you have to get an agreement in place."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"I think there are changes you can make to the agreement, better sunsets and changes to the inspections, but overall that is what we should do. And I am the one person on this debate stage, on the first night of the very first debate, when we were asked what we saw as the biggest threat to our world, I said China on the economy, but I said Iran because of Donald Trump. Because I feared that exactly what happened would happen, enrichment of uranium, escalation of tensions, leaving frayed relations with our allies. We can bring them back, understanding this is a terrorist regime that we cannot allow to have a nuclear weapon."
2020-01-14,Biden,"No, not now. I wouldnít meet with him without any preconditions. Look, we gave him everything heís looking for. Legitimacy, the President showed up, met with him, gave him legitimacy, weakened the sanctions we have against them. I would be putting what I did as Vice President. Iíve met with Xi Jinping more than anyone else. I would be putting pressure on China to put pressure on Korea, to cease and desist from their nuclear power, make their efforts to deal with nuclear weapons. I would move forward as we did before and you reported it extensively Wolf, about moving forward the whole notion of defense against nuclear weapons."
2020-01-14,Biden,"And when China said to me, when Xi Jinping said to me, ìThatís a threat to us.î I said, ìWeíre going to move and protect our interests unless you get involved and protect it.î I would re-ignite the relationship between Japan and South Korea and I would put enormous pressure on China because itís also in their interest for them to put pressure on North Korea to cease and desist. But I would not meet with absent preconditions. I would not meet with the ìSupreme leaderî who said, ìJoe Biden is a rabid dog. He should be beaten to death with a stick.î I count that."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Other than that, you like him."
2020-01-14,Biden,Other than that I like him and he got a love letter from Trump right after that.
2020-01-14,Steyer,"No. Itís very clear that if weíre going to do something with North Korea, weíre going to have to do it in concert with our allies. That meeting with him without preconditions is not going anywhere, that the staff can meet to try and see how far we can get. But this is a classic situation where the United States idea of going it alone makes no sense. And when you are talking about Iran, letís face it, Iran is under great pressure economically. So every single discussion weíve had about Iran has had to do with military power and America versus Iran. Whereas in fact what worked with President Obama was an Alliance of our allies and us, putting economic pressure on them for them to give up their military tactic. That to me is called strategy, having a goal to make America safer by looking more broadly than just us as the policemen of the world-"
2020-01-14,Steyer,Ö Spending money.
2020-01-14,Sanders,"The answer is we could do much better than a Trump led trade deal. This deal, and I think the proponents of it acknowledge, will result in the continuation of the loss of hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs, as a result of outsourcing. The heart and soul of our disaster trade agreements and Iím the guy who voted against NAFTA and against permanent normal trade relations with China, is that we have forced American workers to compete against people in Mexico, in China, elsewhere, who earn starvation wages, a dollar or $2 an hour."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Second of all, every major environmental organization has said no to this new trade agreement because it does not even have the phrase climate change in it. And given the fact that climate change is right now the greatest threat facing this planet, I will not vote for a trade agreement that does not incorporate very, very strong principles to significantly lower fossil fuel emissions in the world."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"The AFL-CIO does, the machinists union does not. And every environmental organization in this country, including the sunrise organization who are supporting my candidacy, opposes it. So I happen to believe, and I hope we will talk about climate change in a moment. If we do not get our act together in terms of climate change, the planet that weíre going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren will be increasingly unlivable and uninhabitable."
2020-01-14,Sanders,Well they are the same in this issue.
2020-01-14,Warren,"I do. I wasnít here, I havenít been in Congress long enough to have voted against NAFTA, but I led the fight against the trade deal with Asia and the trade deal with Europe because I didnít think it was in the interest of the American people, the American workers or environmental interests. But we have farmers here in Iowa who are hurting and they are hurting because of Donald Trumpís initiated trade wars. We have workers who are hurting because the agreements that have already been cut, really donít have enforcement on workers rights."
2020-01-14,Warren,"This new trade deal is a modest improvement, Senator Sanders himself has said so. It will give some relief to our farmers, it will give some relief to our workers. I believe we accept that relief, we try to help the people who need help and we get up the next day and fight for a better trade deal. We need a coherent trade policy. We need a policy that actually helps our workers, our farmers. We need them at the table, not just a trade policy written for big international companies. Iím ready to have that fight but letís help the people who need help right now."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Well, I think that it is not so easy to put together new trade legislation. If this is passed, I think it will set us back a number of years. Senator Warren is right, in saying we need to bring the stakeholders to the table, that is the family farmers here in Iowa and in Vermont and around the country. That is the environmental community, thatÖ"
2020-01-14,Sanders,"In Vermont and around the country, that is the environmental community. That is the workers. Bottom line here is I am sick and tired of trade agreements negotiated by the CEOs of large corporations."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"Brianne, I want to hit reality here. I serve on the agriculture committee, and I will never forget going to Crawfordsville here in Iowa, and thank you for bringing up Iowa, Brianne, since that is where we are. I went to this plant, and there was one worker left in that plant. That plant had been shut down because of Donald Trumpís trade policies and because of what he had done to those workers, with giving secret waivers to oil companies and ruining the renewable fuel standard."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"That worker brought out a coat rack of uniforms, and he said, ìThese are my friends. They donít work here anymore.î Their names were embroidered on those uniforms, Derek, Mark, Salvador, and that guy started to cry."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"These are real people hurt by Donald Trumpís trade war. So what we should do, and I support the USMCA. I am glad that these improvements were made that are supported by people like Richard Trumka and Sherrod Brown, on labor and environment, on pharma, the sweetheart deal, because I think we need a big trading block with North America to take on China. The way you are stronger than China is with your allies."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"Yes, it has been improved. It is not perfect, but when you sit down with the people who are most impacted, they share just how much harm has been done to them by things like the trade war and just how much we can benefit, American consumers and workers and farmers, by making sure we have the right kind of labor and enforceability, as Democrats ensured we got in this USMCA."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"But letís acknowledge why there is such fear and frustration. In my part of the country, in the industrial Midwest, I remember when they came around in the í90s, selling trade deals, telling us, ìDonít worry about your slice of the pie. The pie will get so much bigger that everyone will be better off,î and that promise was broken. The part about the pie getting bigger happened. Itís just that the part about it getting to most people where I live did not."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"That is why there was such frustration. The sense that these decisions in board rooms and in committee rooms in Washington are being made not based on whatís best for us, but based on their own game."
2020-01-14,Biden,"Thereíll be no trade agreements signed in my administration without environmentalist and labor at the table, and there will be no trade agreement until we invest more in American workers. We should be putting our money and our effort and our time in preparing America workers to compete in the 21st century on the high- tech side, dealing with artificial intelligence. We should be focusing on equipping American workers to do that."
2020-01-14,Biden,"By the way, the idea Ö I donít know that thereís any trade agreement that the senator would ever think made any sense, but the problem is that 95% of the customers are out there. So weíve got to figure out how we begin to write the rules of the road, not China."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Joe and I have a fundamental disagreement, in case you havenít noticed, and that is NAFTA, PNTR with China, other trade agreements were written for one reason alone, and that is to increase the profits of large multinational corporations. The end result of those two, just PNTR with China, Joe, and NAFTA cost us some 4 million jobs as part of the race to the bottom."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"I am sick and tired and will not tolerate, and we will use the power of the federal contracting system. If a corporation in America wants to shut down in Iowa or Vermont or any place else and then they think theyíre going to get online for a generous federal contract, theyíve got another thing going. We need some corporate responsibility here, and we need to protect good-paying jobs in America, not see them go to China, Mexico, Vietnam."
2020-01-14,Biden,"We need corporate responsibility, and I agree with that completely. But we also need to have enforcement mechanisms in the agreements we made, enforceable agreements. Thatís one of the things that has been improved with the trade agreement with Mexico, and thatís what we should be doing in any agreement we have."
2020-01-14,Biden,"But letís get back to the basics here. If we donít set the rules of the road by going out to our partners, instead of poking our finger in the eye of all our friends and allies. We make up 25% of the worldís economy. Weíve got to bring the other 25% of our allies along with us to set the rules of the road so China cannot continue to abuse their power by stealing an actual are stealing our intellectual property and doing all the other things using their corporate state system to our significant disadvantage."
2020-01-14,Warren,"Our problem is not just that we need corporate responsibility. Itís been the structure of how these trade deals have been negotiated. The United States has had a strategy for decades, and that strategy has been to have government trade negotiators, a small number, and then surround them with giant multinational corporation lobbyists and corporate executives who whisper in the ears of our negotiators and then get deals cut that are great for the giant multinational corporations, not good for America, not good for American workers, not good for the environment."
2020-01-14,Warren,"We need a different approach to trade, and it starts by calling out the corruption of these giant corporations that have cut our trade deals. Everybody wants to get to the American market, and we need to put some standards in place. You want to be able to sell your goods here, then youíve got to meet some environmental standards. Youíve got to meet labor standards."
2020-01-14,Warren,We need a coherent approach.
2020-01-14,Steyer,"Look. On the first day, I would undo Mr. Trumpís tariffs. On the first day, I would get rid of his waivers that Senator Klobuchar was referring to, to oil refiners not having to use corn-based ethanol."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"In fact, these trade deals have been exactly what Senator Sanders and Warren have been saying, which is that theyíve been designed to grow the American GDP for the corporations of America, not for the working people of America, and not to protect the climate."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"So let me say this. Iím the only person on this stage who says climate is my number one priority. I would not sign this deal, because if climate is your number one priority, you canít sign a deal, even if itís marginally better for working people, until climate is also taken into consideration."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"Look. Iíve got four kids between the ages of 26 and 31. I cannot allow this country to go down the path of climate destruction. Everybody in their generation knows it. Frankly, Mayor Buttigieg, youíre their generation. Iíd think you would be standing up more. Look. Thatís why Iím standing up for it. We cannot put climate on the backseat all the time and say, ìWeíre going to sign this one more deal. Weíre going to do one more thing without putting climate first.î Thatís why itís my number one priority. We can do it in a way that makes us richer, but we have to do it."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"Well, thatís right. This issueís personal for me. Thatís why weíre going to tackle climate from day one. Itís why weíve got to make sure that we have better answers than we do today."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"Now, what Iíve noticed is pretty much all of us propose that we move on from fossil fuels by the middle of the century, starting with actions that we take right now. The question is how are we going to make sure any of this actually gets done? Because people have been saying the right things in these debates for literally decades."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"The other day in Winterset, there was a kid at one of my events. Raised his hand, and he pointed out that he expects to be here in his nineties, in the year 2100. He will sit in judgment over what we do, not just what we on this stage do, anyone old enough to vote right now, whether we actually put together the national project it will require to meet our climate goals, to act aggressively, not just rejoining the Paris Climate Accord. Thatís table stakes, but to actually move on from the fossil-dependent economy we live in today."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Well, as a matter of fact, I didnít say it, and I donít want to waste a whole lot of time on this, because this is what Donald Trump and maybe some of the media want. Anybody that knows me knows that itís in comprehensible that I would think that a woman could not be President of the United States. Go to YouTube today. Thereís a video of me 30 years ago, talking about how a woman could become President of the United States."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"In 2015, I deferred, in fact, to Senate Warren. There was a movement to draft Senator Warren to run for President, and you know what? I stayed back. Senator Warren decided not to run, and I did run afterwards."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by three million votes. How could anybody in a million years not believe that a woman could become President of the United States? Let me be very clear. If any of the women on this stage or any of the men on this stage win the nomination Ö I hope thatís not the case. I hope itís me. But if they do, I will do everything in my power to make sure that they are elected in order to defeat the most dangerous President in the history of our country."
2020-01-14,Sanders,That is correct.
2020-01-14,Warren,"I disagreed. Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie. But look. This question about whether or not a woman can be President has been raised, and itís time for us to attack it head-on. I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at peopleís winning record."
2020-01-14,Warren,"So can a woman beat Donald Trump? Look at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost ten elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that theyíve been in are the women. The only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican anytime in the past 30 years is me, and hereís what I know. The real danger that we face as Democrats is picking a candidate who canít pull our party together or someone who takes for granted big parts of the Democratic constituency."
2020-01-14,Warren,"We need a candidate who will excite all parts of the Democratic Party, bring everyone in, and give everyone a Democrat to believe in. Thatís my plan, and that is why Iím going to win."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"Thank you, Elizabeth."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,I would like to Ö
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"Oh, okay."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"I thought it was such an open end. I wasnít at the meeting, so I canít comment, but I was going to say Ö"
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,I hear that. People have said it. Thatís why Iíve addressed it from this stage. I point out that you donít have to be the tallest person in the room. James Madison was five foot four. You donít have to be the skinniest person in the room. You donít have to be the loudest person. You have to be competent.
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"When you look at the facts, Michigan has a woman governor right now, and she beat a Republican, Gretchen Whitmer. Kansas has a woman governor right now, and she beat Kris Kobach. Her name is Ö Iím very proud to know her, and her name is Governor Kelly. Thank you."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"Third, I would add to this you have to be competent to win, and you have to know what youíre doing. When you look at what I have done, I have won every race, every place, every time. I have one in the reddest of districts. I have won in the suburban areas, in the rural areas. I have brought people with me. That is why I have the most endorsements of current Iowa legislators and former Iowa legislators in this race Ö"
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,Ö because I know I bring people with me.
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"Finally, every single person that I have beaten, my Republican opponents, have gotten out of politics for good. I think that sounds pretty good. I think that sounds pretty good with the guy we have in the White House right now."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Well, just to set the record straight, I defeated an incumbent Republican running for Congress."
2020-01-14,Warren,When?
2020-01-14,Sanders,"1990. Thatís how I won. Beat a Republican Congressman. Number two, of course Ö"
2020-01-14,Warren,30 years ago.
2020-01-14,Sanders,Ö I donít think thereís any debate on Ö
2020-01-14,Warren,Wasnít that 30 years ago?
2020-01-14,Sanders,I beat an incumbent Republican Congressman.
2020-01-14,Warren,I said I was the only one who has beaten an incumbent Republican in 30 years.
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Well, 30 years ago is 1990, as a matter of fact. But I donít know that thatís the major issue of the day. I think what the major issue of the day is Ö Does anybody in their right mind thing that a woman cannot be elected President? Thatís enough. Nobody believes that. Hillary Clinton got 3 million votes, more votes than Trump. So who believes that a woman canít win? Of course a woman can win."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"But the real question is how do we beat Trump? The only way we beat Trump is by a campaign of energy and excitement and a campaign that has, by far, the largest voter turnout in the history of this country."
2020-01-14,Sanders,I believe that our campaign has the strongest grassroots movement.
2020-01-14,Sanders,We are endorsed by many grassroots organizations.
2020-01-14,Warren,"So I do think itís the right question, how do we beat Trump? Hereís the thing. Since Donald Trump was elected, women candidates have outperformed men candidates in competitive races. In 2018, we took back the House. We took back state houses because of women candidates and women voters."
2020-01-14,Warren,"Look. Donít deny that the question is there. Back in the 1960s, people asked, ìCould a Catholic win?î Back in 2008, people asked if an African American could win. Both times, the Democratic Party stepped up and said yes, got behind their candidate, and we changed America. Thatís who we are."
2020-01-14,Biden,"I agree women can win, and Iíve went in and campaigned for 27 of them, this last in 2018 the best group Iíve ever campaigned for in terms of competence. But the real issue is who can bring the whole party together and represent all elements of the party, African Americans, brown, black, women, men, gay, straight? The fact of the matter is that I would argue that, in terms of endorsements around the country, endorsements wherever we go, I am the one who has the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Well, what I will tell you is Medicare for All, which will guarantee comprehensive healthcare to every man, woman, and child, will cost substantially less than the status quo. Medicare for All will end the absurdity of the United States paying, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and healthcare in general."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"While we have 87 million uninsured and underinsured and while 30,000 people die each year, on the Medicare for All, one of the provisions we have to pay for it is a 4% tax on income, exempting the first $29,000. So the average family in America that today makes $60,000 would pay $1,200 a year, compared to that family paying $12,000 a year. We save money, comprehensive healthcare, because we take on the greed and the profiteering and the administrative nightmare that currently exist in our dysfunctional system."
2020-01-14,Biden,"I think we need to be candid with voters. I think we have to tell them what weíre going to do and what itís going to cost, and a 4% tax on income over $24,000 doesnít even come close to paying for between 30 and some estimates as high as $40 trillion over ten years. Thatís doubling the entire federal budget per year."
2020-01-14,Biden,"Thereís a way to do that. The way to do that is to take Obamacare, re-instate, rebuild it, provide a public option, allow Medicare for those folks who want it, and, in fact, make sure that we, in the process, reduce the costs of drug prices, reduce the cost of being able to buy into the Ö subsidize it further, and make it available to everyone. Hereís the deal. That costs a lot of money that cost $740 billion over ten years. I lay out how I pay for that."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Well, first of all, what Joe forgets to say is when you leave the current system as it is, what you are talking about, all workers paying, on average, 20% of their incomes for healthcare, that is insane. Youíve got 500,000 people going bankrupt because they cannot pay their medical bills. Weíre spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as do the people of any other country."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Look. Weíve talked about healthcare for all in this country for over 100 years. Now is the time to take on the greed and corruption of the healthcare industry, of the drug companies, and finally provide healthcare to all through a Medicare for All single payer program. It wonít be easy, but that is what we have to do."
2020-01-14,Biden,You can do it without Medicare for All. You can get the same place.
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"Yeah. Senator Sanders and I have worked together on pharmaceuticals for a long, long time, and we agree on this. But what I donít agree with is his position on healthcare. This debate isnít real. I was in Vegas the other day, and someone said, ìDonít put your chips on a number on the wheel that isnít even on the wheel.î Thatís the problem."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,Over two thirds of the Democrats in the US Senate are not on the bill that you and Senator Warren are on. You have numerous governors that are Democratic that donít support this. You have numerous House members that put Nancy Pelosi in a speaker.
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"The answer is a nonprofit public option. The answer is the real debate we should be having is how do we make it easier for people to get coverage for addiction and mental health. I have a plan for that, and then, finally, what should we do about long-term care, the elephant that doesnít even fit in this room? We need to make it easier for people to get long-term care insurance. We need to make it easier for them to pay for their premiums."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"My own dad, I know when his long-term care insurance ends, and then we have some savings for him. Heís in assisted living. He got married three times, whole nother story. So there isnít much there. But then we go to Medicaid, and Iíve already talked to Catholic elder care. Theyíre willing to take him in."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,Our story is better than so many other families. We have to make it easier for long-term care.
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,Itís not just for senators. Itís also for the sandwich generation Ö
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,Ö people trying to help their parents.
2020-01-14,Warren,"So we need to start with whatís happening in America. People are suffering. Iíll just pick one. 36 million people last year went to the doctor, got a prescription. This is what they needed to get well, and they couldnít afford to have the prescription filled. They looked at it and said, ìItís either groceries or this prescription.î"
2020-01-14,Warren,My approach to this is weíve got to get as much help to as many people as quickly as possible. I have worked out a plan where we can do that without raising taxes on middle class families by one thin dime.
2020-01-14,Warren,"What I can do are the things that I can do as President on the first day. We can cut the cost of prescription drugs. Iíll use the power thatís already given to the President to reduce the cost of insulin and EpiPens and HIV/AIDS drugs. Letís get some relief to those families, and I will defend the Affordable Care Act."
2020-01-14,Warren,"Iíve got a plan to expand healthcare. But letís keep in mind, when we come to a general election, we Democrats may argue among each other about the best way to do healthcare, but weíre going to be up against a Republican incumbent who has cut healthcare for millions of people and is still trying to do that. Iíll take our side of the argument any day. Weíre going to beat him on this."
2020-01-14,Biden,"The [inaudible 01:00:41] my layout does, in fact, limit drug costs. It allows all the drug companies to Ö Excuse me, it allows Medicare to negotiate with drug companies for the price. Itís sets a system whereby you cannot raise the price of a drug beyond the cost of medical inflation. By the way, thereís mental health parity that I call for in the Obamacare expanded with the Biden option."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"Look. Weíve had this conversation on this stage so many times. Everybody on this stage believes that affordable healthcare is a right for every single American. Everybody on this stage knows that Americans are paying twice as much for healthcare as any other advanced country in the world. It makes no sense, and the government has to step in."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"I do happen to agree with vice President Biden that we should move and develop the Affordable Care Act with a public option, but the real question is this. This is not a new problem. Why do we keep having this conversation? We have a broken government. It has been bought by corporations that include the drug companies, the insurance companies, and the private hospitals."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"Thatís what Iím talking about. How do we get back government of, by, and for the people? How do we actually break the corporate stranglehold on our government so that we can get any of these things passed?"
2020-01-14,Sanders,"No, our plan wouldnít bankrupt the country. In fact, it would much improve the wellbeing of working class families and the middle class. Let us be clear what Medicare for all does. It ends all premiums. It ends all copayments. It ends the absurdity of deductibles. It ends out-of-pocket expenses. It takes on the pharmaceutical industry, which, in some cases, charges us ten times more for the same prescription drugs sold abroad as sold here."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"What we will do through a Medicare for All single payer program is substantially lower the cost of healthcare for employers and workers, because we end the hundred billion dollars a year that the healthcare industry makes and the $500 billion a year we spend an the administrative nightmare of dealing with thousands of separate insurance plans."
2020-01-14,Sanders,Healthcare is a human right. Every other major country on Earth is guaranteeing healthcare for all. The time is long overdue for us to do the same.
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"Again, I think it is much better to build on the Affordable Care Act, and if you want to be practical and progressive at the same time and have a plan and not a pipe dream, you have to show how youíre going to pay for it."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"I would also note, practically, that the Affordable Care Act right now is ten points more popular than the President of the United States. So I think the answer is to build on it, and yes, I think you should show how youíre going to pay for things, Bernie. I do. This President is [inaudible 01:03:57] people out. Theyíre like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"The way he is adding to our debt, I am the one person up here who has on her website, in her plan, a plan to actually start taking on the deficit by taking part of that money from that corporate tax cut that they put in there and putting it in a fund to pay back the deficit."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"I have shown how Iím going to pay for every single plan, capital gains thatís going to the personal level Ö"

2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"Ö doing something about the hedge fund loophole. You can go through, and you can get the money to pay for things."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"Well, itís making sure that there is no such thing as an uninsured American. Look. The individual mandate was an important part of the ACA, because the system doesnít work if there are free riders."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"What Iím offering is a choice. You donít have to be in my plan if thereís another plan that you would rather keep, and thereís no need to kick Americans off the plans that they want in order to deliver healthcare for all. My plan is paid for. Look. Our party should no longer hesitate to talk about the issue of the debt and the deficit. Weíve got a dramatically better track record on it than Republicans do. In my lifetime, itís almost invariably Republican Presidents who have added to the deficit. $1 trillion under this President."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"Itís why everything Iíve put forward, from Medicare for all who want it to the historic investments weíre going to make an infrastructure to dealing with climate change is fully paid for. What comes to healthcare, you can do it in two moves. Of course, my plan costs $1.5 trillion over a decade. No small sum, but not the 20, 30, 40 that weíre hearing about from the others."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"All Iíve got to do is two things. Both of them are common sense. Allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, and roll back the Trump corporate tax cuts that went to corporations."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,Roll back the Trump corporate tax cuts that went to corporations and the wealthy that didnít even need it.
2020-01-14,Warren,"So I started this by talking about 36 million Americans including Americans with insurance who just canít even afford to have a prescription filled. We all talk about plans, healthcare plans that we have, and these plans are paid for. The problem is that plans like the mayorís and like the vice presidentís is that they are an improvement. They are an improvement over where we are right now. Not going to be enough to cover prescriptions for 36 million people who canít afford to get them filled. What we need to do is make the commitment that we know where the money comes from. We can ask those at the very top, the top 1% to pay a little more. Those giant corporations like Chevron and Amazon who paid nothing in taxes. We can have them pay, and we can go after the corporate tax cheats. And when we do that, we have enough money to provide healthcare for all our people."
2020-01-14,Warren,"Tax cheats. And when we do that, we have enough money to provide healthcare for all our people. Yes, we build on the Affordable Care Act, but where we end up is we offer healthcare to all of our people, and we can offer it at no cost or low cost to all of them."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"Itís just not true that the plan Iím proposing is small. Weíve got to move past a Washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the treasury, that the boldness of a plan only consists of how many Americans it can alienate. This would be a game changer. This would be the biggest thing weíve done to American healthcare in a half century."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"Letís measure the effects of our plans based on what they would do in our everyday lives and yes, weíre taking on costs on prescription drugs, weíll have an out-of-pocket cap. Even if you donít get the subsidies that would make it free, a $250 monthly cap and hereís why itís got to be monthly. You ever been in that situation or known somebody who finds that theyíve got to defer a procedure or delay filling a prescription to try to have it happen in the right month because of when your out-of-pocket cap hits? It makes no sense medically because most of us donít experience the economy on an annual basis. Our bills donít come in every year. They come in every month. Same with our paychecks, biweekly or monthly. Thatís why we set this up in a way to solve the problem without running up 20, 30 $40 trillion bills."
2020-01-14,Warren,"Look, the numbers that the mayorís offering just donít add up. The average family in America last year paid $12,000 in some combination of deductibles and copays, and uncovered expenses and fees. You canít cover that with the kind of money that the mayor is talking about. The way we have to approach this is weíve got to build this and weíve got to build the alliances to make this happen. I can bring down the cost of prescription drugs like insulin and take hundreds of millions of dollars out of the system immediately in costs. We can get help to families, but we have to be willing to work together."
2020-01-14,Warren,"We can let people experience what healthcare is like when itís you and your doctor, your mental health professional, your nurse practitioner with no insurance companies standing in the middle. [crosstalk 01:09:12] When people try it and use it, then."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"Senator Warren, you acknowledged that Medicare for all, that you couldnít get there right away. You got on the bill that said on page eight, which is why I didnít get on it, that you would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance. Then a few months ago, you said, ìNo, youíre going to wait a while to get there.î And I think that was some acknowledgement that maybe what weíre talking about is true. And I donít buy that itís not enough. It is a big, big step to say to people making $100,000 a year that, ìYour premiums will be cut in half.î Which is what the nonprofit public option will do. And if you talk, mayor Buttigieg, about Medicare and having negotiation, I actually have led that bill for years. I have 34 co-sponsors. As president, I can get it done. That would allow Medicare to finally negotiate and lift the ban that big pharma got into law that says they canít negotiate for better prices for our seniors. I will it done."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"We build into our Medicare for all program a transition fund of many, many billions of dollars that will provide for up to five years income and healthcare and job training for those people. But here is the issue, Tom Steyer made the point a moment ago. We are now spending twice as much per person on healthcare as do the people of any other country. That is insane. In some cases, 10 times more for prescription drugs. Why is that? Why is that? And the answer is the greed and corruption of the drug companies and the insurance companies. And if we want to do what every other major country on Earth does and guarantee people healthcare as a human right, not a privilege, you know what we have to do? We are finally going to have to stand up to the healthcare industry-"
2020-01-14,Steyer,Can I respond to this?
2020-01-14,Sanders,And end hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and profiteering.
2020-01-14,Steyer,"I just want to emphasize what Senator Sanders said. This is not a complicated problem. Between what Senator Warren and Senator Sanders said, itís clear. There are two problems. Weíre spending way too much because corporations own the system, and weíre not negotiating against those corporations and weíve given tax cuts to the richest Americans and the biggest corporations for decades. Thatís all this is. We have corporations who are having their way with the American people and people are suffering. Senator Warren is right. This is cruelty for money. In order to break this, weíre going to have to break the corporate stranglehold and solve both the tax and the negotiating problem. Thatís why Iím for term limits. We need to redo Washington DC [crosstalk 01:12:27] and actually take back the government from the corporations who bought it."
2020-01-14,Biden,"I would argue that the biggest breakthrough in recent time was us being able to do in our administration what five Democratic presidents couldnít get done, and that is pass Obamacare. It was a big deal. Secondly, I would argue that the way you control drug prices is you limit what they can charge for those prices, you donít have to pay the price. Limit what they can charge. If in fact they charge more than we set the price for, in fact, people can import from abroad assuming that it is safe. We in factÖ Itís only yellow. Okay? And we can in fact do all of this and still provide people the option to stay the roughly 150 to 160 million Americans who like the negotiated plan they have with their employers, if they donít like it or the employer gets rid of it, they can buy into a Medicare plan in the Biden plan."
2020-01-14,Warren,"So, letís do this both ways. What I also have said is Iím just going to use the power that is available, and I will do what a president can do all by herself on the very first day, and that is lower the prices of certain prescription drugs. I will lower the price of insulin. We already have the legal authority with the president to do that. President just hasnít picked up and used it. I will lower the price of EpiPens, of HIV/AIDS drugs. Thatís going to bring a lot of relief to a lot of families immediately, but you know there are a whole lot of drugs, about 90% of drugs that are not under patent. Theyíre generic drugs, but the drug industry has figured out how to manipulate this industry to keep jerking the prices up and up and up. So my view is letís give them a little competition."
2020-01-14,Warren,"The government lets contracts for all kinds of things. They let contracts to build buildings, they let contracts to build military weapons. Letís let the contracts out, put the contracts out so that we can put more generic drugs out there and drive down those prices. This is a way to make markets work, not to try to move away from the market. You donít have to even use price controls. The whole idea behind it is get some competition out there so the price of these drugs that are no longer under patent drops where it should be."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"I am open to looking at it, but I would try these things first. Number one, I mentioned the Medicare negotiation. Number two, I have a plan, 137 things Iíve found that a president can do herself in the first 100 days without Congress that are legal, and one of those things is that you can start bringing in less expensive drugs from other countries. Bernie and I had an amendment on this. We got 14 Republican votes on it. It was at midnight. They mightíve not known what they were voting for, but we got that. I now have an actual bill with Senator Grassley that does that, and I have a bill to get at what Elizabeth was talking about, which is to stop generics from taking money from big pharmaceuticals to keep their products off the market. The issue here is that there are two pharma lobbyists for every member of Congress."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"They think they own Washington. They donít own me. And as president, I will get this done."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"It makes no sense for childcare to cost two thirds of somebodyís income. Weíve got to drive it to 7% or below, and zero for those families who are living in poverty. But this is happening to folks at every level of the income spectrum. I meet professionals who sometimes say that theyíre working in order to be able to afford childcare in order to be able to be working. It makes no sense and it must change and we shouldnít be afraid to put federal dollars into making that a reality. Subsidizing childcare and making sure that we are building up a workforce of people who are paid at a decent level to offer early childhood education as well as childcare at large. We can do that and until we do this will be one of the biggest drivers of the gender pay gap because when somebodyís like the the voter asking the question has to step out of the workforce because of that reason, she is at a disadvantage when she comes back in, and that can affect her pay for the rest of her career."
2020-01-14,Warren,"No, actually my plan is universal childcare for everyone. It just has some people adding a small payment, but understand this about the plan. Iíve been there. You know, I remember when I was a young mom, I had two little kids and I had my first real university teaching job. It was hard work. I was excited, but it was childcare that nearly brought me down. We went through one childcare after another and it just didnít work."
2020-01-14,Warren,"If I hadnít been saved by my Aunt Bee, I was ready to quit my job. And I think about how many women of my generation just got knocked off the track and never got back on. How many of my daughterís generation get knocked off the track and donít get back on. How many mamas and daddies today are getting knocked off the track and never get back on."
2020-01-14,Warren,"I have a two-cent wealth tax so that we can cover childcare for all of our children and provide universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old in America, and stop exploiting the people who do this valuable work, largely black and brown women. We can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America. Thatís an investment in our babies. Thatís an investment in their mamas and their daddies and itís an investment in our teachers and in our economy."
2020-01-14,Warren,Itís what we need to do.
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Yeah. Let me just pick up on this childcare thing. Every psychologist in the world knows zero through four are the most important years of human life, intellectually and emotionally, and yet our current childcare system is an embarrassment. It is unaffordable. Childcare workers are making wages lower than McDonaldís workers. We need to fundamentally change priorities in America. We should not be one of the few countries that does not have universal, high quality, affordable childcare. We should not be one of the only major countries not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right. We should not be spending more than the 10 next countries on the military, hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. Tax breaks for billionaires, and then to tell the moms and dads in this country, ìWe cannot have [crosstalk 01:20:36] high-quality, affordable childcare.î That is wrong."
2020-01-14,Biden,"There should be free, universal infant care, but hereís the deal. I was a single parent too when my wife and daughter were killed. My two boys I had to raise. I was a young Senator. I just hadnít been sworn in yet, and I was making $42,000 a year. I commuted every single solitary day to Wilmington, Delaware over 500 miles a day. Excuse me, 250 miles a day because I could not afford, but for my family, childcare. It was beyond my reach to be able to do it and thatís why thereís several things we do."
2020-01-14,Biden,"When I tripled the amount of money for title one schools, every child three, four and five-years-old will in fact have full schooling. Theyíll go to school and after school programs, which will release some of the burden. Secondly, I think we should have an $8,000 tax credit, which would put 7 million women back to work. They could afford to go to work and still care for their children as an $8,000 tax credit. I also believe that we should, in fact, for people who in fact are not able to afford any of the infant care to be able to get that care. But Bernieís right. We have to raise the salaries of the people who are doing the care, and I provide for that as well. My time is up. I know, but Iím not going to go over like everybody."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"Well, itís simple. We expect and hope for everyone to get through 12th grade. Itís not the same for college. Now again, I donít want cost ever to be a barrier to somebody seeking to attend college, and under my plan it wonít be. Matter of fact, for the first 80% of Americans by income, it is free at public colleges, but if youíre in that top income bracket, donít get me wrong, I still wish you well. I hope you succeed when you go to college. I just need you to go ahead and pay that tuition because we could be using those dollars for something else."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"There is a very real choice about what we do with every single taxpayer dollar that we raise. And we need to be using that to support everybody, whether you go to college or not, making sure that Americans can thrive, investing in infrastructure and something that hasnít come up very much tonight, but deserves a lot of attention. Poverty, you know, the Poor Peopleís Campaign is marching on Iowa right now, calling on us to talk about this issue more. They are driven by their faith. I think, because even though in politics weíre supposed to talk middle-class, they know thereís no scripture that says, ìAs youíve done under the middle-class, so youíve done unto me.î"
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"We got to be making sure that we target our tax dollars, where they will make the biggest difference. And I donít think subsidizing the children of millionaires and billionaires to pay absolutely zero in tuition of public colleges is the best use of those scarce [crosstalk 01:23:52] taxpayer dollars."
2020-01-14,Warren,"So look, the way I think we need to do this is we need a wealth tax in America. We need to ask people with fortunes above $50 million to pay more, and that means that the lowliest millionaire that I would tax under this wealth tax would be paying about $19 million in the first year in taxes. If he wants to send his kid to public university, then Iím okay with that because what we really need to talk about is the bigger economic picture here. We need to be willing to put a wealth tax in place to ask those giant corporations that are not paying to pay because thatís how we build an economy and for those who want to talk about it, bring down the national debt. You do universal child care, and you got a lot of mamas who can go to work. A lot of mamas who can finish their education. We make that investment in universal college. Weíve got [crosstalk 01:24:44] people who would finish an education."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"No. And let me say this, I was one of the people who talked about a wealth tax, almost a year-and-a-half ago. I believe that the income inequality in this country is unbearable, unjust and unsupportable, and the redistribution of wealth to the richest Americans from everyone else has to end. And I proposed a wealth tax almost a year-and-a-half ago to start to address it and to raise some of the money that we need. But I want to go beyond this and go back to this question about education because weíre talking a lot about college."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"But in fact, if you talk about the Poor Peopleís Campaign, you have to realize that for the youngest kids, they are getting an education thatís relative to the taxes in their neighborhoods. We need to redistribute money so every kid has a chance. So weíre not legislating inequality for the next generation. And so, we actually invest in every single kid, specifically poor kids, specifically black kids, specifically brown kids. We need to start using the money dramatically more for that."
2020-01-14,Biden,"Itís irrelevant. Thereís no choice but for Nancy Pelosi and the House to move. He has in fact committed impeachable offenses. Whether the Senate makes that judgment or not is for them to decide, and by the way, Iím told that I say we have to unite the country. Itís going to be harder after this trial. It may be, but look, you know, I understand how these guys are, this Republican party. Theyíve gone after, Savage, my surviving son. Gone after me, told lies that your networks and others wonít even carry on television because theyíre flat out lies, and I did my job. The question is whether or not he did his job. And he hasnít done his job, and so it doesnít really matter whether or not heís going after me, Iíve got to be in a position that I think of the American people. I canít hold a grudge. I have to be able to not only fight, but also heal, and as president of the United States, thatís what I will attempt to do, not withstanding that weíre going to be more division after heís defeated by me this next time."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"No. We have a constitutional duty to perform here. And when I look at what the issue is, itís whether or not weíre going to be able to have witnesses. Weíve asked for only four people as witnesses, and if our Republican colleagues wonít allow those witnesses, they may as well give the president a crown and a scepter. They may as well make him king. And last time I checked, our country was founded on this idea that we didnít want to be ruled by a king."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"And I think the best way to think about this trial and what weíre facing in this election is a story of a man from Primghar, Iowa. His name was Joseph Welch. He came from humble beginnings, a son of immigrants. He became the army counsel, and he was the one that went to the Joseph McCarthy hearings. And when McCarthy was blacklisting people and going after people because of their political beliefs or supposed political beliefs, there was only one man. Everyone that was afraid, theyíre afraid of being blacklisted. Joseph Welch, he stood up and looked at McCarthy and said, ìHave you no sense of decency, sir? Have you no sense of decency?î"
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,This is a decency check on our government. This is a patriotism check. Not only is this trial that-
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"But also this election, and no matter if you agree with everyone here on the stage, I say this to [crosstalk 01:34:52] Americans, you know this is a decency check on this president."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"Well Wolf, actually what Iíve done is to organize a petition drive of eight-and-a-half million Americans to sign and say this president deserves to be impeached and removed from office. And those eight-and-a-half million people have called their Congress people, have emailed their Congress people and have actually dragged Washington DC to see that in fact, this is a question of right and wrong and not of political expediency."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"So, if you ask me whether standing up for whatís right in America, standing up for the American people and our safety, standing up for the constitution, whether doing that and trying to bring the truth in front of the American people in televised hearings so we can decide what the truth is for ourselves, if you think that that isnít worth it, then you donít share the idea that I do about what Americaís about. Standing up for whatís right is always worth it, Wolf, and I will never back down from that."
2020-01-14,Warren,"Look, some things are more important than politics. I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America. It says that no one is above the law that includes the president of the United States. If we have an impeachment trial, I will be there because it is my responsibility. But understand this, what that impeachment trial is going to show once again to the American people, and something we should all be talking about, is the corruption of this administration. Thatís what lies at the heart of it. It is about Donald Trump putting Donald Trump first, not the American people, not the interests of the United States of America, not even in helping Ukraine defend against Russia. It is about him helping himself. That is what we need to do to win this election. We need to draw that distinction and show that as Democrats, weíre not going to be the people who are just out for the big corporations, people who want to help themselves, that we are going to be the party that is willing to fight on the side of the people. Thatís why weíre here."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"Thatís why we have to fight climate change with such urgency. Climate change has come to America from coast to coast. Weíre seeing it in Iowa. Weíve seen it in historic floods in my community. I had to activate our emergency operation center for a once in a [inaudible 01:38:04] flood. Then two years later, had to do the same thing. In Australia there are literally tornadoes made of fire taking place. This is no longer theoretical. This is no longer off in the future. We have got to act, yes to adapt, to make sure our communities are more resilient, to make sure our economy is ready for the consequences that are going to happen one way or the other. But we also have to ensure that we donít allow this to get any worse. And if we get it right, farmers will be a huge part of the solution. We need to reach out to the very people who have sometimes been made to feel that accepting climate science would be a defeat for them. Whether weíre talking about farmers, or industrial workers in my community, and make clear that we need to enlist them-"
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,In the national project to do something about this.
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,We are going to have to use federal funds to make sure that we are supporting those whose li-
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"Ö. Funds to make sure that we are supporting those whose lives will inevitably be impacted further by the increased severity and the increased frequency. And by the way, that is happening to farms, that is happening to factories and that disproportionally happens to black and brown Americans, which is why equity and environmental justice have to be at the core of our climate plan going forward."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"Look, what youíre talking about is whatís called managed retreat. Itís basically saying, weíre going to have to move things because this crisis is out of control and itís unbelievably expensive. And of course, weíre going to come to the rescue of Americans who are in trouble. But this is why climate is my number one priority. And Iím still shocked that Iím the only person on this stage who will say this. I would declare a state of emergency on day one on climate. I would do it from the standpoint of environmental justice and make sure we go to the black and brown communities where you canít breathe the air or drink the water that comes out of the tap safely. But I also know this, weíre going to create millions of good paying union jobs across this country. Itís going to be the biggest job program in American history."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"So I know we have to do it, I know we can do it and I know that we can to do it in a way that makes us healthier, that makes us better paid and is more just. But the truth of the matter is, weíre going to have to do it and weíre going to have to make the whole world come along with us and itís going to have to be priority one."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"I absolutely am. Look, we invested in every part of the economy and over 10 years ago I realized that there was something going on that had to do with fossil fuels, that we had to change. So I divested from fossil fuels. I took the giving pledge to give most of my money away while Iím alive. And for 12 years, Iíve been fighting the climate crisis. Iíve beat oil companies in terms of clean air laws. Iíve stopped fossil fuel plants in Oxnard, California. I fought the Keystone Pipeline. I have a history of over a decade of leading the climate fight successfully-"
2020-01-14,Steyer,"So actually, yes, I am the person here who has the chops and the history that says Iíll make it priority one because Iíve been doing it for a long time."
2020-01-14,Warren,"Yes. Climate change threatens every living thing on this planet and the urgency of the moment cannot be overstated. I will do everything a president can do all by herself on the first day. I will roll back the environmental changes that Donald Trump is putting in place. I will stop all new drilling and mining on federal lands and offshore drilling. Thatíll help us get in the right directions. Iíll bring in the farmers. Farmers can be part of the climate solution. We should see this though for the problem it is. Mr. Steyer talks about it being problem number one. Understand this, we have known about this climate crisis for decades. Back in the 1990s, we were calling it global warming, but we knew what it was. Democrats and Republicans back then were working together because no one wanted a problem."
2020-01-14,Warren,"But you know what happened? The industry came in and said, we can make big money if we keep them divided and make no change. Priority number one has to be taking back our government from the corruption. That is the only way we will make progress on climate, on gun safety, on healthcare, on all of the issues-"
2020-01-14,Warren,That matter to us.
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"Well, first of all, I would note that I have a 100% rating from the League of Conservation Voters and that is because I have stood tall on every issue that we have talked about up here, when it comes to this administration, this Trump administration, trying to reverse environmental protections. I think it is going to lead to so many problems and one thing that hasnít been raised by the way is the rules on methane, which is actually one of the most environmentally dangerous hazards that they have recently embarked on. And I would bring those rules back as well as a number of other ones."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"When it comes to the issue of fracking, I actually see natural gas as a transition fuel. Itís a transition fuel to where we get to carbon neutral. Nearly every one of us has a plan that is very similar and that is to get to carbon neutral by 2045 to 2050. To get to by 2030 do a 45% reduction. And I want to add one thing that no oneís really answered. When we do this, we have to make sure that we make people whole and when we put a tax on carbon, which we will do, either through CAP and trade or through a renewable electricity standard or through a fee on carbon."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,Then we have to make sure the money goes back to the people that will be hurt by it. [crosstalk 01:44:17] To help with their energy bills and to bring jobs to areas that will lose jobs.
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Thank you. Letís be clear, if we as a nation do not transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, not by 2050, not by 2040, but unless we lead the world right now, not easy stuff, the planet we are leaving our kids will be uninhabitable and unhealthy. We are seeing Australia burning. We saw California burning. The drought here in Iowa is going to make it harder for farmers to produce the food that we need. This is of course a national crisis. Iíve introduced legislation to indicate itís an actual crisis. We have got to take on the fossil fuel industry and all of their lies and tell them that their short term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. Thatís what the Green New Deal does. Thatís what my legislation does and that is what we have to do."
2020-01-14,Biden,"My response is back in 1986, I introduced the first climate change bill and check Politifacts, they said it was a game changer. Iíve been fighting this for a long time. I headed up the Recovery Act, which put more money into moving away from fossil fuels to solar and wind energy than ever has occurred in the history of America. Look, what we have to do is we have to act right away and the way we act right away is immediately. If Iím elected president, Iíll reinstate all the mileage standards that existed in our administration, which were taken down, thatís 12 billion gallons of gasoline, barrels of gasoline to be saved immediately. And with regard to those folks who in fact are going to be victimized by whatís already happened. We should be investing in infrastructure that raises roads, makes sure that weíre in a position where we have Ö every new highway build is a green highway. [inaudible 01:46:18] 550,000 charging stations."
2020-01-14,Biden,"We can create, and this is where I agree with Tom, we can create millions of good paying jobs. Weíre the only country in the world thatís ever take great crisis and turn it into a great opportunity. And one of the ways to do it is with farmers here in Iowa, by making them the first group in the world to get to net-zero emissions by paying them for planting and absorbing carbon in their fields right away. Thereís more to say, but I know-"
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"The black voters who know me best are supporting me. Thatís why I have the most support in South Bend. Itís why among elected black officials in my community, who have gotten into this race, by far most of them are supporting me. And now nationally, I am proud that my campaign has co-chaired by a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and to have support right here in Iowa from some of the most recognizable black elected leaders. From Mayor Hart of Waterloo to former Representative Berry in Black Hawk County. Now, the biggest mistake we could make is to take black votes for granted and I never will. The reason I have the support I do is not because any voter thinks that Iím perfect. Itís because of the work that we have done facing some of the toughest issues that communities can."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"Not from the luxury of a of a debate or a television panel or a committee room, but on the ground. Issues from poverty to justice in policing. And Iím proud to say weíve been nationally recognized for our work as a race informed city on delivering greater economic justice. That we have reduced use of force by leading the region in transparency around the use of force in policing. Of course, there is a much longer way to go, in my community and around the country. But I will be a president whose personal commitment is to continue doing this work."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Nope, not at all. And that is because the campaign that we are going to run will expose the fraudulency of who Donald Trump is. Donald Trump is corrupt. He is a pathological liar and he is a fraud. Now when Trump talks about socialism, what he talks about is giving hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. Donald Trump as a businessman, received $800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury housing. My democratic socialism says healthcare is a human right. Weíre going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. Weíre going to make public colleges and universities tuition free. Weíre going to have a Green New Deal and create up to $20 million, saving the planet for our children and our grandchildren. We are going to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance company. That is what democratic socialism is about and that will win this election."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"Look, we know how Donald Trump is going to run for president. Heís going to run on the economy. Heís already told Americans last month in Florida, you donít like me and I donít like you, but youíre all going to vote for me because the Democrats are going to destroy the economy in 15 minutes if they get in control. So letís be clear, I started a business by myself in one room. I didnít inherit a penny from my parents. I spent 30 years building that business into a multi-billion dollar international business. Then I walked away from it and took the giving pledge and started organizing coalitions of ordinary Americans to take on unchecked corporate power. But whoever is going to beat Mr. Trump is going to have to beat him on the economy and I have the experience and the expertise to show that heís a [inaudible 01:50:58] and a fraud. Look, Mayor Pete has three years as an analyst at McKinsey. I have 30 years of international business experience, I can beat Trump on the economy. Weíre going to have to beat him on the economy and I look forward to taking him down in the fall on the debate stage."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"You demoted me, I was actually an associate but thatís okay. It was not the biggest part of my career, but I am ready to take on this president on the economy because I am from the exact kind of industrial Midwestern community that he pretends to speak to and has proven to turn his back on and guided that community through a historic transformation. When at the beginning of the decade I took office, we were described as a dying city. Iím ready to take on Donald Trump because when he gets to the tough talk and the chest thumping, heíll have to stand next to an American war veteran and explain how he pretended bone spurs made him ineligible to serve."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"And if and if he keeps trying to use religion Ö If a guy like Donald Trump keeps trying to use religion to somehow recruit Christianity into the G.O.P., I will be standing there not afraid to talk about a different way to answer the call of faith and insist that God does not belong to a political party. I am ready to take on this president on every front."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"Our voters, actually all Americans have seen now a number of years of a guy that has, I think, told over 15,000 lies. He is someone that literally has a rap sheet of divisive rhetoric. And I think what Americans want is something different. I am going to be able to stand across from him on that debate stage and say to my friends in Iowa, the Midwest is not flyover country for me, I live here. Iím going to be able to look at him and say, youíve treated these workers and farmers like poker chips. For me, these are my friends and these are my neighbors. Iím going to be able to look at him and say, you know what? You got $413 million over the course of your career, thatís how you built your fortune."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"And what Iím going to say is this, my grandpa worked 1500 feet underground in the iron ore mines, saved money in a coffee can in the basement to send my dad to a two year community college. Thatís my family trust. And when you have been given an opportunity like that, you go into the world, not with the sense of entitlement, Donald Trump, but with a sense of obligation."
2020-01-14,Warren,"So I was born and raised in Oklahoma. I have three older brothers who are all retired, who are all back there still. And two of my three brothers are Republicans. And sure, there are a lot of things we disagree on and we can take to our corners and do the Democratic, Republican talking points. But the truth is thereís a whole lot we agree on. You know, my brothers just furious over Chevron and Eli Lilly and Amazon, that are giant corporations make billions of dollars in taxes Ö make billions of dollars in profits and pay nothing in taxes. My brother said, ìI donít get this. I have to pay my taxes. Somebody has to keep the roads paved and the schools open and pay for our defense.î"
2020-01-14,Warren,"They understand that we have an America right now thatís working great for those at the top. Itís just not working for anyone else. We have a chance to unite, unite as Democrats, but also with independents and Republicans, who are sick of living in a country thatís working great for the politicians that are taking the money. Itís working great for the lobbyists. Itís working great for the corporate executives. Itís just not working for everyone else. Iím building the grassroots movement, leading the fight. Weíre going to make this America work for everyone else. That is how weíre going to beat Donald Trump."
2020-01-14,Biden,"I am prepared for that. Look, Iíve been the object of his affection now more than anybody else on this stage. Iíve taken all the hits he can deliver and Iím getting better in the polls, my going up. And by the way, I have overwhelming support from the African American community, overwhelming more than everybody else in this operation, number one. Number two, working class people, where I come from in Pennsylvania and the places I come from in Delaware, I have great support. I have support across the board and Iím not worried about taking on Donald Trump at all. And with regard to the economy, I can hardly wait to have that debate with him. Where I come from, the neighborhoods I come from, theyíre in real trouble, working class people and middle class people. When the middle class does well, working class has a way up and the wealthy do well. But whatís happening now? Theyíre being clobbered, theyíre being killed."
2020-01-14,Biden,"They now have a situation where if they Ö the vast majority believe their children will never reach the stage that theyíve reached an economic security. I love that debate because the American public is getting clobbered. The wealthy are the only ones doing well, period. Iím looking forward to the economic debate."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"Donald Trump thinks this is all about him. I think itís about you. Itís not about his resorts or his tweets or even his ego. It is about your healthcare. It is about your schools. It is about your lives and your future. So if you want to do something about racial justice and immigration reform and climate change and gun safety, we need a candidate who is actually going to bring people with her. I have won every race, every place, every time. I have gotten the highest voter turnout in the country when Iíve led the ticket. I have passed more bills as the lead Democrat than anyone whoís in Congress thatís running for president. I believe that we need a president thatís going to look out for you. It is easy to hurl insults. It is easy to draw lines in the sand and sketch out grand ideological sketches that will never see the light of day."
2020-01-14,Klobuchar,"What is hard is bringing people together and finding common ground instead of scorched earth. What is hard is the work of governing. So if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me. Join me at amyklobuchar.com."
2020-01-14,Steyer,"I know that Iowans are going to caucus within three weeks and I want to tell you how I feel about the American people. Look, I played team sports my entire life. The bond between teammates is deep and emotional and full of love and as far as Iím concerned, the American people are my teammates. And if thereís one thing I will not permit, it is someone to run down the field and kick my teammate in the face. And that is exactly what Iíve seen over the last seven years traveling around this country, seeing these Republicans led by Mr. Trump, basically kicking the American people in the face. I am prepared to take on Mr. Trump on the debate stage and take him down on the economy. But I am asking for your support because I know that if Iím going to be a good teammate to you and give you absolutely everything without any compromise, I need the support of you on caucus night so I can turn around and together we can take back this country and together we can save the world."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,"This is our moment. This is our one shot to defeat Donald Trump and to do it by such a big margin that we send Trumpism into the dustbin of history too. Well, we cannot take the risk with so much on the line of trying to confront this president with the same Washington mindset and political warfare that led us to this point. If you are watching this at home and you were exhausted by the spectacle of division and dysfunction, Iím asking you to join me to help turn the page on our politics. Youíre seeing the President boast about the Dow Jones wondering whether any of that will ever get to your kitchen table. Join me if youíre a voter of color feeling taken for granted by politics as usual. Join me if youíre used to voting for the other party, but right now cannot look your kids in the eye and explain this president to them, join me."
2020-01-14,Buttigieg,We have a chance to change all of this if we can summon the courage to break from the past. That is why I am running for president. It is why Iím asking you to caucus for me on February 3rd and I hope that you will go to peteforamerica.com and join me in this effort.
2020-01-14,Warren,"So, much is broken in this country. I sat here in the break and just made notes about many of the things we didnít get to talk about tonight. How the disability community is struggling for true equality, how gun violence and active shooter drills worry every mother in this country. How children are living in poverty and seeing their life chances shrink. How trans women, particularly trans women of color are at risk. Black infant mortality, climate change that particularly hits black and brown communities. People who are being crushed by student loan debt, farmers who are barely holding on, people struggling with mental illness. And yet I come here tonight with a heart filled with hope and itís filled with hope because I see this as our moment in history, our moment when no one is left on the sidelines. Our moment when we understand that it comes to us to decide the future of this country. Our moment when we build the movement to make real change, hope and courage. That is how I will make you proud every day as your nominee and as the first woman president of the United States of America."
2020-01-14,Sanders,"Itís been a good debate, but we havenít asked the major question. The major question is how does it happen in the richest country in the history of the world that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck, trying to get by, $9, $10 bucks an hour? How does it happen that when the top one percent owns more wealth than the bottom 92%, half a million people are sleeping out on the streets tonight? How does it happen in this great country we are the only major nation not to guarantee healthcare to all. How does that happen that we have a child care system which is dysfunctional, a criminal justice system which is broken and racist, an immigration system that needs reform. This is the moment when we have got to think big, not small. This is the moment where we have got to have the courage to take on the one percent, take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create an economy and create a government that works for all of us, not just the one percent. Thank you."
2020-01-14,Biden,"Character is on the ballot this time around. The American character is on the ballot. Not what Donald Trump is spewing out, the hate, the xenophobia, the racism. Thatís not who we are as a nation. Everyone in this country is entitled to be treated with respect and dignity. Every single solitary person has to have in a position that may in fact we treat them with decency. Itís about fundamental, basic decency. We in the United States of America can put up with Ö we can overcome four years of Donald Trump, but eight years of Donald Trump will be an absolute disaster and fundamentally change this nation. We have to restore Americaís soul. As Iíve said from the moment I announced, it is in jeopardy under this President of the United States. We lead the world when we lead by example, not by our power."
2020-01-14,Biden,"We in fact have to regain the respect of the world in order to be able to change things. Ladies and gentlemen, we are in a position right now we have to remember who we are. This is the United States of America. Thereís not a single thing beyond our capacity to do if we do it together, letís go do it."
2019-12-19,Biden,"You know, Judy, it was a constitutional necessity for the House to act as it did, and Trumpís response to suggest that only half of the American people want to see him thrown out of office now, I find is dumbing down the presidency beyond what I even thought he would do. Is any wonder that if you look at the international polling thatís been done that the Chinese leader is rated above American, the American president. Or that Vladimir Putin congratulated him saying, ìStand fast,î and in fact it was a mistake to impeach him. We need to restore the integrity of the presidency, of the office of the presidency. And itís about time we get that underway. My job, and I think the job of all of us up here, is to, in fact, well thatís not true, some are going to be actually voting in the Senate. But my job is to just go out and make the case why he doesnít deserve to be president of United States for another four years."
2019-12-19,Sanders,"Well, Judy, what I would say is that we have a president who is a pathological liar. We have a president who is running the most corrupt administration in the modern history of this country. And we have a president who is a fraud, because during his campaign he told working people one thing, and he ended up doing something else. I believe, and I will personally be doing this in the coming weeks and months, is making the case that we have a president who has sold out the working families of this country, who wants to cut social security, Medicare, and Medicaid, after he promised he would not do that, and who has documentedly lied thousands of times since he is president. And the case to be made is, yeah, certainly, I disagree with Trump on virtually all of his policies, but what conservatives, I think, understand, is that we cannot have a president with that temperament, who is dishonoring the presidency of the United States."
2019-12-19,Warren,"So I see this as a constitutional moment. Last night, the president was impeached, and everyone now in the Senate whoís taken a constitutional oath to uphold our constitution, and that doesnít mean loyalty to an individual, it doesnít mean loyalty to a political party, it means loyalty to our country, and that vote will play out over the next several weeks. But the way I see this is weíve now seen the impact of corruption, and thatís whatís clearly on the stage in 2020, is how we are going to run against the most corrupt president in living history. This president has made corruption, originally, his argument, that he would drain the swamp. And yet he came to Washington, broke that promise, and has done everything he can for the wealthy and the well-connected, from tax breaks to ambassadorships. We have to prosecute the case against him, and that means we need a candidate for president who can draw the sharpest distinction between the corruption of the Trump administration and a Democrat who is willing to get out and fight, not for the wealthy and well-connected, but to fight for everyone else. Thatís why Iím in this race."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"Let me make the case to the American people. As a wise judge said, ìThe president is not king in America; the law is king.î And what James Madison once said when he was speaking out at the constitutional convention, and by the way I think heís a pretty good size for a president, he was five foot four. And what he said, he said the reason that we have these impeachment articles in the constitution, that the provisions are in there, is because he feared that a president would betray the trust of the American people for a foreign power. That is what happened here. Watergate. This is a global Watergate. In the case of Watergate, a paranoid president facing election looked for dirt on a political opponent. He did it by getting people to break in. This president did it by calling a foreign leader to look for dirt on a political opponent."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"And I would make this case: as we face his trial in the Senate, if the president claims that he is so innocent, then why doesnít he have all the presidentís men testify? Richard Nixon had his top people testify. We should be hearing from Mulvaney, who is the one under oath. Witnesses have said that Mulvaney is the one that said, ìOkay, weíre going to withhold this aid to a fledgling democracy to get dirt on a political opponent.î We should hear from Bolden, who told his own staff to go see a lawyer after they met with the president. That is the case. If President Trump thinks that he should not be impeached, he should be not scared to put forward his own witnesses."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"At the end of the day, this is beyond public opinion, this is beyond polls, this is beyond politics. The president left the House with no choice, and I think a lot of us are watching this process, watching Washington go through the motions and not expecting much, but a foregone conclusion when it gets to the Senate. We cannot give in to that sense of helplessness because thatís what they want. They want us to be taken in by that cynicism where we give up on the process altogether. Meanwhile, their allies are laughing all the way to the bank."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"As we see policies that let giant corporations, some of which made billions in profits, pay, not just zero, but as weíve recently learned, negative taxes, all while they block policies that would actually boost wages for working Americans. Hereís the good news ñ itís up to us. No matter what happens in the Senate, it is up to us in 2020. This is our chance to refuse to be taken in by the helplessness, to refuse and reject the cynicism. That is what this presidential election is about. It is what my campaign is about. Our opportunity in 2020, no matter what happens in Washington, as a country, to change the course of this nation for the better."
2019-12-19,Steyer,Iím over here.
2019-12-19,Steyer,"Judy, Judy, sorry."
2019-12-19,Steyer,"Well, let me remind everyone that Iím the person who started The Need to Impeach movement over two years ago. Because I believe what counts here is actually the American peopleís opinion. Over eight and a half million signed that petition and dragged Washington into the idea that actually the most corrupt president in American history, itís not a question of political expediency, itís not a question of political tactics, itís a question of right and wrong. So now when we look whatís going on, I actually agree with Senator Klobuchar. The question here is, if we want the American people to understand whatís going on, we need to have the administration officials testify on TV so we can judge."
2019-12-19,Steyer,"The court that counts here is the court of public opinion. The American people deserve to see the truth of these administration officials testifying under oath, so we can make up our mind. If we want Republican senators to do the right thing, we need their constituents to see the truth on TV, and tell them, ìGet rid of this guy or weíll get rid of you.î Thatís what I believe in. Iím a believer in the grassroots, as an outsider, getting the American peopleís voice to count. Thatís who I trust and thatís who I trust now."
2019-12-19,Yang,"Itís clear why Americans canít agree on impeachment. Weíre getting our news from different sources, and itís making it hard for us even to agree on basic facts. Congressional approval rating, last I checked, it was something like 17 percent, and Americans donít trust the media networks to tell them the truth. The media networks didnít do us any favors by missing a reason why Donald Trump became our president in the first place. If you turn on cable network news today, you would think heís our president because of some combination of Russia, racism, Facebook, Hillary Clinton, and e-mails all mixed together."
2019-12-19,Yang,"But Americans around the country, no different. We blasted away four million manufacturing jobs that were primarily based in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri. I just left Iowa. We blasted 40,000 manufacturing jobs there. The more we act like Donald Trump is the cause of all of our problems, the more Americans lose trust that we can actually see whatís going on in our communities and solve those problems. What we have to do is we have to stop being obsessed over impeachment, which unfortunately strikes many Americans like a ballgame where you know what the score is going to be, and start actually digging in and solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place. We have to take every opportunity to present a new positive vision for the country, a new way forward to help beat him in 2020, because make no mistake, heíll be there at the ballot box for us to defeat."
2019-12-19,Sanders,"Judy, youíre talking to somebody who, unlike some of my colleagues here, voted against NAFTA, voted against PNC [inaudible 00:11:45] with China, two agreements that cost us over four million decent-paying jobs. Now, I donít agree with the, your statement that people think this is going to be a great job creator. This is a modest improvement over what we have right now. It would allow, hopefully, Mexican workers to organize into unions or independent unions, and be able to negotiate decent contracts. But at the end of the day, in my view, it is not going to stop outsourcing. It is not going to stop corporations from moving to Mexico, where manufacturing workers make less than two dollars an hour. What we need is a trade policy that stands up for workers, stands up for farmers, and, by the way, the word ìclimate change,î to the best of my knowledge, is not discussed in this new NAFTA agreement at all, which is an outrage. So no, I will not be voting for this agreement, although it makes some modest improvements."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"I have a different view. Iíll go with my friend Sherrod Brown, who has voted against every trade agreement thatís come in front of him, and heís voting for this, and I am too. And the reason I am voting for it is that I believe that we have a change with this agreement. I would not have voted for the agreement that President Trump put forward, but weíve got better labor standards, better environmental standards, and a better deal when it comes to the pharmaceutical provision, which I also oppose."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"95 percent of our customers are outside of our borders, and we have to make sure that we have trade agreements that are more fair, because if we can encourage work made in America, every time you hold something in your hand that says ìmade in America,î it is the ingenuity of our workers. It is equality of a product, it is equality of our workers, and it is the hopes and dreams of the American people. I think this agreement, while Senator Sanders is correct, there are some issues with it, is much better than the one originally proposed. And for those farmers in the Midwest, and for those people that have been hurt by the fact that we will not have a trade segment with Mexico and with Canada and the United States, I think that this is a much better deal."
2019-12-19,Biden,"Well, I donít think they really do like the economy. Go back and talk to the old neighbors in the middle class neighborhoods you grew up in. The middle class is getting killed. The middle class is getting crushed and the working class has no way up as a consequence of that. You have, for example, farmers in the Midwest, 40 percent of them could pay, couldnít pay their bills last year. You have most Americans, if theyíve received the bill for 400 dollars or more, theyíd have to sell something or borrow the money."
2019-12-19,Biden,"The middle class is not, is behind the eight ball. We have to make sure that they have an even shot. We have to eliminate significant number of these god-awful tax cuts that were given to the very wealthy. We have to invest in education. We have to invest in healthcare. We have to invest in those things that make a difference in the lives of middle class people so they can maintain their standard of living. Thatís not being done, and the idea that weíre growing, weíre not growing. The wealthy, very wealthy are growing. Ordinary people are not growing. They are not happy with where they are, and thatís why we must change this presidency now."
2019-12-19,Yang,"Yes. Where I live folks arenít measuring the economy by how the Dow Jones is looking, theyíre measuring the economy by how theyíre doing. When youíre doing the bills at the end of the month at your kitchen table, and you find that, even if your wages have gone up, is not nearly going as fast as the cost of health, and howísÖ This economy is not working for most of us, for the middle class, and, I know youíre only ever supposed to say middle class and not poor in politics, but weíve got to talk about poverty in this country."
2019-12-19,Yang,"There is not one county in the United States of America where someone working full time at the minimum wage can afford a two bedroom apartment. In most places, not even a one bedroom apartment. The biggest problem in our economy is simple ñ people are not getting paid enough. That is not the result of some mysterious cosmic force. Itís the result of bad policy, and weíve got to change it by raising wages and empowering workers."
2019-12-19,Yang,"GDP and corporate profits are at record highs in America today. Also at record highs, depression, financial insecurity, student loan debt, even suicides and drug overdoses. It has gotten so bad that our life expectancy as a country has declined for the last three years, because suicides and drug overdoses have overtaken vehicle deaths for the first time in American history. The fact is, this unemployment rate and GDP have very little relationship with peopleís lived experience on the ground. If youíre a recent college graduate, you have a 40 percent chance of doing a job that doesnít require a college degree. That doesnít show up in the headline unemployment rate, nor does all of the families that are working two or three jobs to get by."
2019-12-19,Warren,I do.
2019-12-19,Warren,"Well, I want to ask-"
2019-12-19,Warren,This question-
2019-12-19,Warren,"Because hereís the problem. Iím proud to stand on a stage with Democrats who understand that a rising GDP, rising corporate profits, is not being felt by millions of families across this country. Iím proud to stand on a stage with people who see that Americaís middle class is being hollowed out, and that working families and poor people are being left behind."
2019-12-19,Warren,"What we need to talk about, though, is why that has happened, and the answer is weíve got a government that works great for those with money, and doesnít work for much of anyone else. We have a government that works great for giant drug companies, just not for someone trying to fill a prescription. Works great for people who want to make money at private prisons and private detention centers at our border, just not for the people whose lives are torn apart. Works great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, but not for the rest of us, who see climate change bearing down upon us. And when you see a government that works great for the wealthy and the well-connected and for no one else, that is corruption, pure and simple, and we need to call it out for what it is."
2019-12-19,Sanders,"Look, hereís the response. Trump goes around saying, ìThe economy is doing great.î Do you know what, real inflation accounted for, wages went up last year? One point one percent. That ainít great. Tonight, while three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America, 500,000 Americans, including 30,000 veterans are sleeping out on the streets. Today in America, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth, more income and wealth inequality since the 1920s. We need an economy that works for working families, not just the 1 percent. That is what our campaign is about."
2019-12-19,Warren,"Oh, theyíre just wrong. Letís start with a wealth tax. The idea of a two cent tax on the great fortunes in this country, 50 million dollars and above. For two cents, what can we do? We can invest in the rest of America. We can provide universal childcare, early childhood education for every baby in this country, age zero to five. Universal pre-K for every three year old and four year old and raise the wage."
2019-12-19,Warren,"Ö Pre K for every three-year-old and four-year-old and raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher. We can do even more for our public schools, for college graduates, we can cancel student loan debt, but think about the economic impact of that. You leave two cents with the billionaires. Theyíre not eating more pizzas, theyíre not buying more cars. We invest that 2% in early childhood education and childcare. That means those babies get top notch care. It means their mamas can finish their education. It means their mamas in their daddies can take on real jobs, harder jobs, longer hours. We can increase productivity in this country and we can start building this economy from the ground up. Thatís how we built it in small towns, thatís how we built it in rural America and thatís how we built it in urban America. An economy that works."
2019-12-19,Warren,"Not from Wall Street, but that works for main stram."
2019-12-19,Steyer,"Let me say that I agree with Senator Warren in much of what she says. Iíve been for a wealth tax for over a year. Iím in favor of undoing all the tax breaks for rich people and big corporations [crosstalk 00:22:18] that this administration has put through. And in addition, Iíve talked about equilibrating the taxes on passive investment income, which would allow us to cut taxes for 95% of Americans by 10%. But thereís something else going on here that I think is really important, and thatís this. We know Mr. Trumpís going to run on the economy."
2019-12-19,Steyer,"I built a business over 30 years from scratch. Weíre going to have to take him on, on the economy in terms of growth as well as economic justice. Weíre going to have to be able to talk about growth, prosperity across the board for everyone in America. My experience building a business, understanding how to make that happen means I can go toe to toe with Mr. Trump and take him down on the economy and expose him as a fraud and a failure. And I think thatís different from the other people on this stage. I think we need a different unconventional way of attacking a different unconventional president who actually went after the-"
2019-12-19,Steyer,Best prepared candidate in American history and beat her.
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"Right now I think weíre being offered a false choice. You either have to go all the way to the extreme or itís business as usual. Yes, we must deliver big ideas and yes, taxes on wealthy individuals and on corporations are going to have to go up. We can also be smart about the promises weíre making. Make sure theyíre promises that we can keep without the kind of taxation that economists tell us could hurt the economy. Itís why, for example, I propose that we make college free for 80% of Americans, but it doesnít have to be free for the top. If youíre in that top 10% how you pay your own tuition and we save those dollars for something else that we could spend them on, that would make a big difference. Whether itís infrastructure, childcare, housing, health. On issue after issue, weíve got to break out of the Washington mindset that measures the bigness of an idea by how many trillions of dollars it adds to the budget or the boldness of an idea by how many fellow Americans it can antagonize."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"Well, I very much hope weíre not going to have to relocate entire cities, but we will probably have to relocate some individual residents. And the problem right now is that this climate change is this existential crisis and you are seeing it here in California with the fires that you just had. You saw it in Northern California as was mentioned with Paradise and the most moving video from that to me was a 30 second video of that dad driving his little girl through the lapping fires with his neighborhood burning behind him and singing to her to calm her down."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"We cannot wait to act. Thereís an Ojibwe saying that great leaders make decisions, not for this generation, but seven generations from now. This president doesnít keep his decisions for seven minutes. So what I think we need to do get back into the International Climate Change Agreement. I will do that on day one. On day two, bring back the clean power rules on day three, the gas mileage standards. I see the governor of California who has been working so hard to get those done, defied every step of the way by the Trump administration. And then introduced sweeping legislation to put a price on carbon and build a fridge to the next century, which means we must upgrade our buildings and our building standards."
2019-12-19,Steyer,"Look, I am hoping that we in fact will do what Iím suggesting, which is declare a state of emergency on day one of my presidency. I believe Iím the only person here who will say unequivocally, this is my number one priority. I know that we have to deal with this crisis. I know that we have to deal with it from the standpoint of environmental justice. Iíve been working on this for more than a decade. Iíve taken on oil companies and beaten them on environmental laws. Iíve pushed clean energy across this country. Iíve prevented pipelines and Iíve prevented fossil fuel plants."
2019-12-19,Steyer,"But I know is this, not only can we clean up the air and water in the black and brown communities where our pollution is concentrated. This is also the opportunity to create literally millions of middle-class union jobs well-paid across the United States of America. Our biggest crisis is our biggest opportunity and if we donít declare a state of emergency on day one, I donít understand how we go to the people around the world to lead the coalition that has to happen and that only America can lead. Look, this is a generational question. I have a lot of respect for the people on this stage. I know everybody is worried about this, but for instance, I would call on Mayor Buttigieg to prioritize this higher. Because the people in his generation understand that this is a crisis that we have to go on right now, but itís also the greatest opportunity to rebuild and reinvent America."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"Well, Iíve made clear that this will be a topic of day one action, and this is not theoretical for me. I live in one of those river cities that youíre talking about. Not only that, I live right by the river. My neighborhood flooded in the second of two once in a millennium floods that we had in two years. Do the math on that so I know whatís at stake and itís why I insist that we act with a carbon tax and dividend with massive increases in renewable research on renewable energy, energy storage and carbon storage. But bigger than that, you have to summon the energies of the entire country to deal with this."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"Iíve seen politicians in Washington saying the right thing about climate change for as long as Iíve been alive. All these plans we have to get carbon neutral by 2050, and I think most or all of us have one. Their impact is multiplied by zero unless something actually gets done."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"And that is why I want to make sure that our vision for climate includes people from the auto worker down the block from me in South Bend, to a farmer a few minutes away, so that they understand that we are asking, recruiting them to be part of the solution."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,Not beating them over the head and telling them they are part of the problem.
2019-12-19,Biden,"The answerís yes. The answerís yes, because the opportunity for those workers to transition to high paying jobs, as Tom said, is real. Weíre the only country in the worldís ever taken great, great crises and turned them into an enormous opportunities. Iíve met with the union leaders. For example, we should, in fact, making sure right now that every new building built is energy contained, that it doesnít leak energy. That in fact we should be providing tax credits for people to be able to make homes turn to solar power where thereís all kinds of folks out here, right here in California. Weíre now on the verge of having batteries that are about the size of the top of this podium that you can store energy when in fact the wind isnít blowing and the sun isnít shining. We have enormous opportunities. For example, you talk about would we relocate people who in fact weíre in a position where they lost their home."
2019-12-19,Biden,"We have to not rebuild to the standard that existed before when we talk about when we come in and help people. We have to rebuild the standard that exists today. For example, we shouldnít build another new highway in America that doesnít have charging stations on it. We have an opportunity to put 550,000 charging stations so that we own the electric vehicle market, creating millions of jobs for people and installing them as well as making sure that we own the electric vehicle market. Thereís so many things we can do and we have to make sure we explain it to those people who are displaced, that their skills are going to be needed for the new opportunities."
2019-12-19,Sanders,"Tim, in all due respect, your question misses the mark. It is not an issue of relocating people in towns. The issue now is whether we save the planet for our children and our grandchildren. The issue, as you should know, what the scientists are telling us, is they have underestimated the threat and severity of climate change. Youíre talking about the Paris Agreement, thatís fine. Ainít enough. We have got to, and Iíve introduced legislation to do this, declare a national emergency. The United States has got to lead the world and maybe, just maybe, instead of spending 1.8 trillion a year globally on weapons of destruction, maybe an American president, i.e. Bernie Sanders can lead the world. Instead of spending money to kill each other, maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy, which is climate change."
2019-12-19,Warren,"So I see right now is, weíve got to get the carbon, weíve got to stop putting more carbon into the air. Weíve got to get the carbon out of the air and out of the water and that means that we need to keep some of our nuclear in place. I will not build more nuclear. I want to put the energy literally and the money and the resources behind clean energy and by increasing by 10 fold what we put into science, what we put into research and development. We need to do what we do best. And that is innovate our way out of this problem and be a world leader. But understand the biggest climate problem we face is the politicians in Washington who keeps saying the right thing, but continue to take money from the oil industry. Continue to bow down to the lobbyist, to the lawyers, to the think tanks to the bought and paid for experts."
2019-12-19,Warren,"America understands that weíve got to make change and weíre running out of time. That climate change threatens every living thing on this planet. But getting Congress to act, they just donít want to hear it. And if we donít attack the corruption first, if we donít attack the corruption head on, then weíre not going to be able to make the changes we need to make on climate, on gun safety, on drug pricing, on all of the big problems that face us. We need a Washington that doesnít just work for the rich and the powerful. We need one that works for our families."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"I wanted to add to what Elizabeth said. So the way we tackle this corruption is by winning big in this election and the way we take on climate change in a big way is by yes, talking about whatís happening on the coast is I just did, but also talking about whatís happening in the Midwest, where Iím from. Itís not fly over country to me, I live there. And what we are seeing there is unprecedented flooding. Weíre seeing an increase. 50% increase in homeowners insurance over the last few years and when we make these changes, we have to make clear to people that when we put a price on carbon that that money is going to come back to those areas where people are going to be hurt, where jobs are going to change and to make them whole with their energy bills. When you make the case like that, you bring in the Midwestern votes, you win big, and I think the best way to do it is by putting someone at the top of the ticket whoís from the Midwest."
2019-12-19,Yang,"Well first we should obviously be paying to relocate Americans away from places that are hit by climate change. Weíre already doing it. We relocated a town in Louisiana that became uninhabitable because the sea levels rose. And we know that town is not alone. Thatís playing out in coastal areas around the country. The question is, do you leave that town on its own to fend for itself or do you come together as a country and say, ìWe need to protect our people from climate change?î Part of my plan is literally called move people to higher ground. Because thatís what we need to do and thatís literal and figurative. Here in California, itís forest fires and forest management. And nuclear power, I agree with the research. We need to have everything on the table in a crisis situation, which this is."
2019-12-19,Yang,"Other countries have had success with nuclear power and the next generation Thoriam reactors have a wealth of potential. Thoriam is not radioactive the way uranium is. It doesnít last as long and you canít make a weapon out of it. Whereas if weíre going to innovate our way out of this, as Elizabeth is saying, then we have to have nuclear on the table."
2019-12-19,Steyer,"The point about nuclear power is, itís not at the stage in the United States where itís competitive on price. It has a lot of risks to it in terms of disasters and we have no ability to store the toxins that come out of it and last a hundred thousand years. We actually have the technology that we need. Itís called wind and solar and batteries. So in fact, what we need to do, we can do. Weíve got to stop taking a look at this as something that we canít do because we can do this, and we can do it in a way that rebuilds this country on an accelerated basis. Creates millions of union jobs and we come at it from the standpoint of environmental justice. This is our greatest opportunity to reinvent this country, to actually take on the biggest challenge in history and succeed together. You want to pull the country together with all this partisanship? Letís take on the biggest challenge in history and succeed together as a nation. Thatís what pulls people together."
2019-12-19,Biden,Yes.
2019-12-19,Biden,"Look, I didnít say return to normal. Normal is not enough. In fact, we would have to move beyond normal, whether itís healthcare or the environment, whatever it is, we have to build on what we had started in our administration and thatís been interrupted very badly. Number one. Number two, with Trump out of the way, itís not going to change things in a fundamental way, but what it will do is it will mean that weíre in a position where his base is not going to be able to intimidate those half a dozen Republicans we may need in other things."
2019-12-19,Biden,"I refuse to accept the notion as some on the stage do that we can never, never get to a place where we have cooperation again. If thatís the case, where dead as a country, we need to be able to reach consensus. And if anyone has reason to be angry with the Republicans and not want to cooperate, itís me the way theyíve attacked me and my son and my family. I have no love. But the fact is, we have to be able to get things done. And when we canít convince them, we go out and beat them like we did in the 2018 election in red states and in purple states."
2019-12-19,Yang,Itís both an honor and disappointment to be the lone candidate of color on the stage tonight.
2019-12-19,Yang,"ÖHonor and disappointment to be the lone candidate of color on the stage tonight. I miss Kamala. I miss Cory, though I think Cory will be back. I grew up the son of immigrants and I had many racial epithets used against me as a kid, but black and Latinos have something much more powerful working against them than words. They have numbers. The average net worth of a black household is only 10% that of a white household. For Latinos, itís 12%. If youíre a black woman, youíre 320% more likely to die from complications in childbirth. These are the numbers that define race in our country. And the question is, why am I the lone candidate of color on this stage? Fewer than 5% of Americans donate to political campaigns. You know what you need to donate to political campaigns? Disposable income."
2019-12-19,Yang,"The way we fix itÖ The way we fix this is we take Martin Luther Kingís message of a guaranteed minimum income, a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for all Americans. I guarantee, if we had a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month, I would not be the only candidate of color on this stage tonight."
2019-12-19,Sanders,"I will answer that question, but I wanted to get back to the issue of climate change for a moment because I do believe this is the existential issue."
2019-12-19,Sanders,"I certainly can because people of color, in fact, are going to be the people suffering most if we do not deal with climate change. And by the way, we have an obligation up here if there are not any of our African American brothers and sisters up here, to speak about an economy in which African Americans are exploited, where black women die three times at higher rates than white women, where we have a criminal justice system which is racist and broken, disproportionately made up of African Americans and Latinos and Native Americans who are in jail. So we need an economy that focuses on the needs of oppressed, exploited people and that is the African American community."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"Iíd say this is America. Youíre looking at it. And we are not going to be able to succeed in the world if we do not invite everyone to be part of our economy. Our constitution says that we strive for a more perfect union. Well thatís what we are in doing right now. And to me that means, one, that everyone can vote, and that includes our communities of color. This action thatís been taken by this president and his people and his governors all over the country is wrong. They have made it harder for African Americans to vote. As one court said, ìDiscriminated with surgical precision.î"
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"What would I do as one of the leaders on voting in the US Senate? One, stop the purging. As Stacey Abrams said, you do not stop having your right to assemble if you donít go to a meeting for a year. Because you donít go to a church or synagogue or a mosque for three months, you donít lose your right to worship. You shouldnít lose your right to vote. I would pass, as president, my bill to register every kid in this country when they turn 18 to vote. That would make all of these discriminatory actions in these states go away and I would stop the gerrymandering, in addition to the agenda of economic opportunity. Because as Martin Luther King says, ìWhat good is it to integrate a lunch counter if you canít afford a hamburger?î"
2019-12-19,Sanders,"Israel hasÖ And I say this is somebody who lived in Israel as a kid, proudly Jewish. Israel has the right, not only to exist, but to exist in peace and security. But what US foreign policy must be about is not just being pro-Israel, we must be pro- Palestinian as well. And whetherÖ In my view. We must understand that right now in Israel we have leadership under Netanyahu, who has recently, as you know, been indicted for bribery. Who in my view is a racist. What we need is a level playing field in terms of the Middle East, which addresses the terrible crisis in Gaza, where 60 or 70% of the young people are unemployed. So what my foreign policy will be about is human rights, is democracy, is bringing people together in a peaceful way, trying to negotiate agreements, not endless wars with trillions of dollars of expenses."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"What we are seeing in the Middle East and around the world are the consequences of this presidentís failure, this presidentís refusal to lead. Itís particularly disturbing in the case of Israel because he has infused domestic politics, making US foreign policy choices in order to effectively interfere in Israeli domestic politics. Acting as though that somehow makes him pro- Israel and pro- Jewish while welcoming white nationalists into The White House."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"But itís not only in the Middle East that we see the consequences of the disappearance of US leadership. We see among our allies and among our adversaries, case after case, where the world is making plans on what to do, ignoring the United States because weíre no longer considered reliable. Itís not just the mockery at a cocktail party on the sidelines of a conference, itís the looks on the faces of the leaders at the UN as they looked at the United States President with a mixture of contempt and pity."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"As an American, I never again want to see the American President looked at that way by the leaders of the world. The world needs America right now, but it canít be just any American. It has to be one that is actually living up to the values that make us who we are. Supporting peace, supporting democracy, supporting human rights and supporting stability around the world."
2019-12-19,Warren,"Yes, itís time to close this detention facility. It not only costs us money, it is an international embarrassment. We have to be an America that lives our values every single day. We canít be an America that stands up and asks people to fight alongside us, as we did with the Kurds in fighting ISIS, and then turn around in the blink of a tweet and say that weíre turning our backs on the people who stood beside us. After that, who wants to be an ally of the United States? We have to be an America that understands the difference and recognizes the difference between our allies, the people who will work alongside us, and the dictators who would do us harm. And we need to treat our allies better than we treat the dictators. That needs to be our job as an America."
2019-12-19,Warren,"We have the finest military on earth. All three of my brothers served and we have people on this stage who have served and Iím deeply grateful for that. Our military is strong and important, but we need to be an America that relies on our State Department, that relies on diplomacy, that relies on our economic power and that relies on working together with the rest of the world to build a world that is sustainable environmentally and economically for everyone."
2019-12-19,Biden,"We attempted to close Guantanamo Bay, but you have to have congressional authority to do it. Theyíve kept it open. And the fact is that we in fact think itís the greatestÖ It is an advertisement for creating terror. Look, what we have done around the world in terms of keeping Guantanamo open or what Trump has done by no longer being an honest broker in Israel, there is no solution for Israel other than a two state solution. It does not exist. Itís not possible to have a Jewish state in Middle East without there being a two state solution. And he has played to all the same fears and all the prejudices that exist in this country and in Israel."
2019-12-19,Biden,"Bibi Netanyahu and I know one another well. He knows that I think what heís doing is outrageous. What we do is we have to put pressure constantly on the Israelis to move to a two state solution, not withdraw a physical aid from them in terms of their security. And lastly, I think that-"
2019-12-19,Biden,"Senator Warren is correct. We have led by, not the example of our power, but the power of our example. And the example weíre demonstrating now is horrible. Itís hurting us badly."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"I think that any tool ought to be on the table, especially diplomatic, economic and social tools like what youíre describing. Look, for the president to let it be known that his silence, whether itís on the rounding up of Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang, putting them into camps, or the aspirations of the people of Hong Kong for democracy. For him to let China know that his silence can be purchased is trashing American values. The reality is that thereís a lot more to the relationship with China than whoís selling more dishwashers? Yes, we need a much smarter trade policy."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"We also have to acknowledge whatís going on over there. The use of technology for the perfection of dictatorship. That is going to require a stronger than ever response from the US in defense of democracy. But when folks out there standing up for democracy hear not a peep from the President of the United States, what message is that sending to the Chinese Communist Party? The message I will send is that if they perpetrate a repeat of anything like Tienanmen Square when it comes to Hong Kong, they will be isolated from the free world and we will lead that isolation diplomatically and economically."
2019-12-19,Steyer,"Look, there is a temptation, particularly for this president, to try and answer that in a bilateral way. The way the United States should be reacting in Hong Kong is by gathering our coalition of democracy and freedom loving partners and allies to push back. In fact, when weíre making moral statements around the world, it should not be us threatening and trying to be the worldís policemen. It should be us leading on a value driven basis with the other people who share our values and want to change the world."
2019-12-19,Steyer,"We actually canít isolate ourselves from China. In fact, we have to work with them as a frienemy. People who disturb us, who we disagree with, but who in effect we are linked to in a world that is ever getting closer. And in fact, if we are going to treat climate as the threat that it is, we are going to have to partner with the Chinese. They are going to have to come along with us. Theyíre going to have to trust us and together weíre going to have to solve this problem. So the ability to say-"
2019-12-19,Steyer,Itís off the table. We need a good relationship with them. Weíre going to have to work with them going forward under all circumstances.
2019-12-19,Warren,"Itís on a collision course with China but not for war. What we have to make clear is that we in fact are not going to abide by what theyíve done. 1 million Uyghurs, as you pointed out, Muslims, are in concentration camps. Thatís where they are right now. Theyíre being abused. Theyíre in concentration camps. And what we started in our administration that Trump stopped, we should be moving 60% of our seat power to that area of the world. To let in fact the Chinese understand that theyíre not going to go any further. We are going to be there to protect other folks."
2019-12-19,Warren,"Secondly, we in fact should make sure that we began to rebuild our alliances, which Trump has demolished, with Japan and South Korea, Australia and Indonesia. We in fact need to have allies who understand that weíre going to stop the Chinese from their actions. We should be gone to the UN immediately and sought sanctions against them and the United Nations for what they did. We have to be firm. We donít have to go to war but we have to make it clear, ìThis is as far as you go, China.î And in terms of their military buildup, itís real but it would take them about 17 years to build up to where we are. Weíre not looking for a war but weíve got to make clear we are Pacific power and we are not going to back away"
2019-12-19,Yang,I have family in Hong Kong. I spent four months there and seeing whatís happening on the streets. Itís shocking. They banned face masks in Hong Kong. Why? Because they have AI technology that now is using facial recognition to identify protesters if they so much as do anything on the street so they can follow up with them and detain them later. This is the rivalry that we have to win where Chinaís concerned. Theyíre in the process of leapfrogging us in AI because they have more data than we do and their government is subsidizing it to the tune of tens of billions of dollars.
2019-12-19,Yang,I have sat with our leading technologists and they say they cannot match the Chinese resources. China just produced its first major smartphone that does not have Google apps and it is now trying to export its technology to the rest of the world. What we have to do is build an international coalition to set technology standards and then you can bring the Chinese to the table in a very real way because this is their top priority and this is where we need to out compete them and win.
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"When it comes to foreign policy, I think we need to keep our promises and keep our threats. And this president has done neither. And a country like China, theyíre leaders, they watch that and they know. He has stood with dictators over innocents. He has stood with tyrants over free leaders. He does it all the time. And I have a little different take than some of my colleagues when it comes to what happened at that conference with NATO. Yeah, they were making fun of him, some of the foreign leaders. Iíve heard senators make more fun of other senators than that. The point of it was that he couldnít even tolerate it. He is so thin skinned that he walked, he quit. America doesnít quit."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"So if we want to send a message to the Chinese, we stand with our allies. We stand with them firmly. We have a very clear and coherent foreign policy when it comes to human rights. Check out my website, amyklobuchar.com. I have the five Rís of our foreign policy. About reasserting our values, rejoining international agreements, like the Iranian nuclear agreement. But it all comes down to one R, returning to sanity."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"Iím actually not worried about the presidentís bad sense of humor when it comes to being made fun of. Iím worried about the fact that he is echoing the vocabulary of dictators around the world. When the American president refers to unfavorable press coverage as the product of the enemy of the people, democracy around the world gets weaker. Freedom of the press, not just here at home but around the world, gets weaker. Itís one more reminder of what is at stake, not just here at home, but for world history, in the imperative that we win this election."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,Could I respond?
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,This is our chance.
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"Okay. I just want to make very clear, Mayor, that the freedom of the press is deep in my heart. My dad was a newspaper man. And I am the one that asked every attorney general candidate weíve had under Donald Trump, both of whom I opposed, about their respect for the First Amendment. And they have refused to follow the rules that Attorney General Holder put in place when it came to protecting our journalists. They would not commit that they wouldnít put a journalist in jail for doing their job. So this is not just talking points to me, this is the real world. And I think that experience that I will bring to The White House with protecting the First Amendment is worth more than any talking points."
2019-12-19,Sanders,And Iím white as well.
2019-12-19,Sanders,"Well, I got a lot of respect for Barack Obama. I think I disagree with him on this one. Maybe a little self-serving, but I do disagree. Here is the issue. The issue is where power resides in America and itís not white or black or male or female. We are living in a nation increasingly becoming an oligarchy, where you have a handful of billionaires who spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying elections and politicians. You have more income and wealth inequality today than at any time since the 1920s. We are the only major country on earth, not to guarantee healthcare for all people, which is why we need Medicare for all. We are facing an existential crisis of climate change. The issue is not old or young, male or female. The issue is working people standing up, taking on the billionaire class, and creating a government and an economy that works for all, not just the 1%."
2019-12-19,Biden,Iím going to guess he wasnít talking about me either.
2019-12-19,Biden,"Look, Iím running because Iíve been around. All my experience. With experience, hopefully, comes judgment and a little bit of wisdom. The fact is that weíre in a position now, the next president of the United States is going to inherit two things. Economy that is out of kilter and a domestic policy that needs to be used where we have to unite America and a foreign policy that requires somebody to be able on day one, stand up, look out the entire world, know who that person is, know what they stand for and know they know them. And thatís the reason Iím running. I have more experience in doing that than anybody on this stage."
2019-12-19,Biden,[crosstalk 00:03:14] Churchill.
2019-12-19,Biden,"Oh, American history."
2019-12-19,Biden,I was joking. It was a joke.
2019-12-19,Biden,Politico doesnít have much of a sense of humor.
2019-12-19,Biden,"No, Iím not willing to commit one way or another. Hereís the deal. Iím not even elected one term yet and letís see where we are."
2019-12-19,Biden,But itís a nice thought.
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"Thank you for asking a woman this question. First of all, we have not had enough women in our government. When I was on Trevor Noahís show once, I explained how in the history of the Senate, there was something like 2000 men and only 50 women in the whole history and he said if a nightclub had numbers that bad, they would shut it down. However, it is not just about numbers. Itís about what you get done. And that is my argument. If you look at the poll at the state that knows me best, and that is the state of Minnesota, it showed in the state that Hillary had her lowest margin of victory. It showed that I beat Donald Trump by 18 points. I beat him with men more than anyone on this stage. So, I think what matters in this election is can you bring in those rural and suburban areas, particularly in the Midwest? And number two, what will you do when you get there?"
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"And I am someone that has passed over 100 bills, with men and women, with Republicans and with Democrats, including changing the sexual harassment laws for the United States Congress. A bill I led, so taxpayers are no longer going to have to pay for people that harass other people. I have passed the law for drug shortages. I have done work in our rural areas. I think thatís what most matters to people. I would be so proud to be the first woman president, but mostly I want to be a president that gets things done and improves peopleís lives."
2019-12-19,Warren,"Iíd also be the youngest woman ever inaugurated. I believe that President Obama was talking about who has power in America, whose voices get heard. I believe heís talking about women and people of color and trans people and people whose voices just so often get shoved out. And for me, the best way to understand that is to look at how people are running their campaigns in 2020. I made the decision when I decided to run not to do business as usual. And now Iím crowding in on 100,000 selfies. Thatís 100,000 hugs and handshakes and stories. Stories from people who are struggling with student loan debt, stories from people who canít pay their medical bills, stories from people who canít find childcare. Now, most of the people on the stage run a traditional campaign and that means going back and forth from coast to coast to rich people and people who can put up 5,000 bucks or more in order to have a picture taken, in order to have a conversation, and in order maybe to be considered to be an ambassador."
2019-12-19,Warren,"No, I want to finish this. Those selfies cost nobody anything. And I get it. In a democracy, we all have a lot of different points of view and everybody gets one vote. But hereís the thing, people who can put down $5,000 to have a picture taken, donít have the same priorities as people who are struggling with student loan debt or struggling to pay off medical debt. Iím running a campaign where people whose voices get heard. We canít have people who can put down $5,000 for a check, drown out the voices of everyone else. They donít in my campaign and they wonít in my white house."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"I canít help but feel that mightíve been directed at me and hereís the thing. Weíre in the fight of our lives right now. Donald Trump and his allies have made it abundantly clear that they will stop at nothing, not even foreign interference, to hold on to power. Theyíve already put together more than $300 million. This is our chance. This is our only chance to defeat Donald Trump. And we shouldnít try to do it with one hand tied behind our back. The way weíre going to win is to bring everybody to our side in this fight. If that means that youíre a grad student digging deep to go online to peteforamerica.com and chip in 10 bucks, thatís great. And if you can drop $1,000 without blinking, thatís great too. We need everybodyís help in this fight. Iím not going to turn away anyone who wants to help us defeat Donald Trump. We need Democrats whoíve been with us all along, yes, but we also need independents worried about the direction of the country. If you were Republican, disgusted with whatís going on in your own party, weíre not going to agree on everything, but we need you in this fight and I will welcome you to our side."
2019-12-19,Warren,"So, the mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served $900 a bottle wine. Think about who comes to that. He had promised that every fundraiser he would do would be open door, but this one was closed door. We made the decision many years ago that rich people in smoke-filled rooms would not pick the next president of the United States. Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the United States."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"You know, according to Forbes magazine, I am literally the only person on this stage whoís not a millionaire or a billionaire. This is important. This is the problem with issuing purity tests, you cannot yourself pass. If I pledge never to be in the company of a progressive democratic donor, I couldnít be up here. Senator, your net worth is 100 times mine. Now, supposing that you went home feeling the holiday spirit, I know this isnít likely but stay with me, and decided to go on to Pete for america.com and give the maximum allowable by law $2,800. Would that pollute my campaign because it came from a wealthy person? No. I would be glad to have that support. We need the support from everybody who is committed to helping us defeat Donald Trump."
2019-12-19,Warren,I do not sell access to my time. I donít do call-time with millionaires and billionaires.
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"Hold on a sec. Sorry, as it went Senator-"
2019-12-19,Warren,"I donít meet behind closed doors with big dollar donors and look, Iíve taken one that ought to be an easy step for everyone here. Iíve said to anyone who wants to donate to me, if you want to donate to me, thatís fine, but donít come around later expecting to be named ambassador because thatís what goes on in these high dollar fundraisers. I said no and I asked everybody on this stage to join me. This ought to be an easy step and hereís the problem. If you canít stand up and take the steps that are relatively easy, canít stand up to the wealthy and well-connected when itís relatively easy when youíre a candidate, then how can the American people believe youíre going to stand up to the wealthy and well-connected when youíre president and itís really hard."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"Senator, Iíve got to respond to this."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"First of all, if you canít say no to a donor, then you have no business running for office in the first place. But also, Senator, your presidential campaign right now as we speak, is funded in part by money you transferred, having raised it at those exact same big ticket fundraisers you now denounce. Did it corrupt you, Senator? Of course not. So, to denounce the same kind of fundraising guidelines that president Obama went by, that Speaker Pelosi goes by, that you yourself went by until not long ago in order to build the democratic party and build a campaign ready for the fight of our lives, these purity tests shrink the stakes of the most important election upon us."
2019-12-19,Warren,He addressed me directly.
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"I did not come here to listen to this argument. I came here to make a case for progress and I have never even been to a wine cave. Iíve been to the Wind Cave in South Dakota, which I suggest you go to. So, what is making a case for progress about? That is what unites us up here instead of what divides us, which is campaign finance reform. That means passing a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. It means making the first bill we pass when I am president will be HR1 which is the ethics reform passed in the house, which is currently sitting on Mitch McConnellís desk along with 400 bills. And if you donít think we can get this done, well we can, but only if we win this election big. Not by arguing with each other but by finding what united us in getting it done. I came to make a case for progress."
2019-12-19,Sanders,"I am rather proud, maybe, I donít know. The only candidate up here doesnít have any billionaire contributions, but you know what I do have? We have received more contributions from more individuals than any candidate in the history of the United States of America at this point in an election, averaging $18 a piece. Now thereís a real competition going on up here. My good friend Joe, and he is a good friend, heís received contributions from 44 billionaires. Pete, on the other hand is trailing. Pete, you only got 39 billionaires contributing. So Pete, we look forward to you. I know youíre an energetic guy and a competitive guy to see if you could take on Joe on that issue. But what is not a laughing matter, my friends. This is why three people own more wealth than the bottom half. This is why Amazon and other major corporations pay zero in federal taxes. We need to get money out of politics. We should run our campaigns on that basis."
2019-12-19,Biden,"My average contribution is $43, number one. Thatís number one. Number two, the idea that the senatorís suggesting that Iím in the pocket of billionaires, when in fact they oppose everything that Iíve ever done and continue to do. I have made sure from the very beginning, every one of my fundraisers is open to the press. Every single solitary one, not one single time period. And Iíve made sure that you know exactly where all the Ö and the largest contribution Iíve accepted is $2,800, which is allowed under the law. And Iím the first person to introduce the constitutional amendment to make sure that there is now all public funding of elections. End all private funding. And we all should make a commitment of that right now on this stage. In the meantime, you got to fund a campaign and we in fact have funded a campaign average contribution, $43."
2019-12-19,Sanders,Can I-
2019-12-19,Steyer,"Listen, Iím running because this government is broken because itís purchased by corporations and Iíve spent 10 years fighting those corporations and beating them and building grassroots organizations to push power down to the people. Thatís what Iíve been doing for a decade. But let me say this, thereís someone whoís loving this conversation and his name is Donald Trump."
2019-12-19,Sanders,Thatís right.
2019-12-19,Steyer,"We know how heís going to run. Heís told us last week, he looked at a group of Americans and said, ìI donít like you. You donít like me. It doesnít matter. Youíre going to support me because the Democrats will destroy the economy in 15 minutes.î We need to go after this guy. Heís a different breed of cat and we need to beat him and we need to talk about prosperity. And I spent 25 years building a business. Weíre going to have to take him on the economy, not have these kinds of conversations and tear each other down, but actually go after this corrupt president and beat him on the economy where he thinks heís king and where in fact heís a fraud and a failure."
2019-12-19,Yang,"Of course, I would. Iím the son of immigrants myself and I know that DREAMers are essentially Americans in everything but this legal classification. I just want to return to this conversation because I think itís core. Our country is deeply misogynist and most all of us know that. Money and men are tied together. Thatís where I thought Elizabeth was taking the conversation. The fact is, strong societies would elect more female leaders. Strong men treat women well for the same reasons. Iím on the record saying that you need both strong men and female leaders in government because the fact is if you get too many men alone and leave us alone for a while, we kind of become morons."
2019-12-19,Yang,"So, itís related to our campaign finance rules because right now the fact is we operate in a fundamentally anti-woman marketplace, and that includes the marketplace for politicians. If we were to put a hundred democracy dollars into the hands of every American voter, instead of 5% contributing, youíd see that rate skyrocket to 50 or 60% and youíd have many, many more women who would run for office because they donít have to go shake the money tree in the wine cave."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,Can I address immigration reform?
2019-12-19,Yang,"I believe everyone on this stage would do the right thing by DREAMers in the first hundred days. I would make it a top priority. Iím the son of immigrants myself. The fact is almost half of fortune 500 companies were started by an immigrant or children of immigrants. Immigrants make our country stronger and more dynamic. And immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have absolutely nothing to do with. If you go to the factory in Michigan, itís not wall to wall immigrants. Itís wall to wall robot arms and machines. We have to send the opposite message of this administration and, as your a president, I think I could send a very clear message, where if youíre considering immigrating to this country and Iím the president, you would realize my son or daughter can become president of the United States. Thatís the opposite of the current administration and thatís the message I would love to send to the world."
2019-12-19,Sanders,I canít respond to the immigration question?
2019-12-19,Sanders,"No. This is what I would do. Day one executive order restore the legal status of 1.8 million young people in the DACA program. Day one we change border policy so that federal agents will never snatch babies from the arms of their mothers. Day one. Day one we introduce bipartisan legislation, which will, in fact, be comprehensive, which will result in a path toward citizenship for all of the 11 million who are undocumented. That is what the people of our country want. Trump thinks mistakenly that he is going to win reelection by dividing us up. We are going to win this election by bringing our people together, black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American. Thatís what this campaign is about. Thatís what America must be about."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"Thank you. I started my day today with a group of immigrants who are there talking to me about housing and I thought about this president and what heís done. He has used our immigrants as political pawns. Every single day, he tries to draw a wedge. I will be a different president. My view on this comes from experience. When I got to the Senate, Senator Kennedy asked me to be one of the two new senators that was in the group to work on the immigration reform package. We got so close to passing that. I voted for it. Not everyone did, but most of the Democrats did. Then I was on the judiciary committee when President Obama was president and we worked very hard on that immigration reform. We actually passed that with Republican votes. Then I was in the small group that worked on the compromise on the DREAMers, that would have solved that problem. We didnít get that done because this president gut-punched us."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,I will take my views. I will take this experience. I will get this done because immigrants donít diminish America. They are America.
2019-12-19,Steyer,"Listen, I think itís important to note that this president is not against immigration. Heís against immigration by non-white people."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,Yes.
2019-12-19,Steyer,"This is his attempt to divide us, as Senator Sanders said, on race. And thatís what heís been doing since the very first day he started running for president. Heís been vilifying non-white people. Heís been trying to inflame his base and scare them that if in fact white people lose control of this country, that theyíre going to lose control of their lives. And as somebody who lives in a majority-minority state, which is California, what heís doing is so wrong on so many different levels. I agree with Senator Sanders. We have to reframe this argument completely. We have to go back to the idea that every American is worth being a full human being on every right. This is a racial argument by a racist president whoís trying to divide us and whoís vilifying people. Itís absolutely wrong and itís led him to break the laws of humanity in our name."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"Yes, and they should have a fast track to citizenship because what the United States did under this president to them was wrong and we have a moral obligation to make right what was broken. And on the larger issue of immigration, my understanding of this issue isnít theoretical. Itís not something I formed in committee rooms in Washington. It begins with the fact that my household, my family came from abroad. My father immigrated to this country and became a U.S. Citizen. It comes from the fact that Iím the mayor of a city where neighborhoods that were left for dying are now coming back to life, largely because of the contributions mainly of Latino immigrants."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"ÖLargely because of the contributions mainly of Latino immigrants. And Iíve seen those same neighborhoods shut down. Families huddling in church, panicking just because of the rumor of an ice raid that does not make our country safe."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,Could I respond.
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"Just to look into the eyes of an eight year old boy whose father was deported even though he had nothing so much as a traffic ticket against his name and try to think of something to tell that boy because I couldnít tell him what he most wanted to hear, which is just that he was going to have his dad back. How can harming that young man possibly make America safer."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"When I am president? Based on those experiences, I will make sure that this is a country of laws and of values and that means not only ending these unspeakable frugal practices at the border, but finally and truly fixing the immigration system that has needed, a full overhaul since the 1980s."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"We cannot wait four years, 10 years. We cannot wait anymore to do something about this."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"I support H.R. 40 which is the bill that has been proposed in Congress to establish a commission to look at reparations, but we shouldnít wait for that commission to do its work to do things that are reparative. Remember weíre not talking about a gift to anybody. Weíre talking about mending what was broken. Weíre talking about the generational theft of the wealth of generations of African Americans. And just crossing out or racist policy and replacing it with a neutral one is not enough to deliver a quality harms compound just like a dollar saved in its value compounds over time. So does the value of a dollar stolen and that is why the United States must act immediately with investments in minority owned businesses with investments in health equity, with investments in HBCUs and on the longer term a look at reparations so that we can mend what has been broken."
2019-12-19,Biden,"Not any, since I havenít spoken on this. Got a chance. Number one, the reason weíre the country we are is because of immigration. Weíve been able to cherry-pick the best from every single continent. The people that come here have determination, resilience. They are ready to stand up and work like the devil. We had a 24 out of every 100 children in our school today is Hispanic. The idea that we are going to walk away and not provide every opportunity for them is not only stupid and immoral but as bad for America. They are the future of America and we should invest in them. Everybody will be benefit from it. Every single American and you should get used to it. This is a nation of immigrants. Thatís who we are. Thatís why we are who we are. Thatís what makes us different and we should invest in them."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"I was hearkening backÖ I made my case on immigration to what the mayor said about Washington. So I look at this a different way. When we were in the last debate mayor, you basically mocked the 100 years of experience on the stage and what do I see on this stage? I see Elizabethís work starting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and helping 29 million people. I see the vice presidentís work in getting a $2 billion for his cancer moonshot. I see Senator Sandersí work working to get the veterans bill passed across the aisle and I see what Iíve done, which is to negotiate three farm bills and be someone that actually had major provisions put in those bills. So what you can dismiss committee hearings. I think this experience works and I have not denigrated your experience as a local official. I have been one-"
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"You know, sorry."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,I just think you should respect our experience when you look at how you evaluate someone who can get things done.
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"You actually did denigrate my experience Senator and it was before the break and I was going to let it go cause we got bigger fish to fry here. But, you implied that my relation-"
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"Oh, I donít think we have bigger fish to fry than picking a president of the United States."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"Youíre right, and before the break you seemed to imply that my relationship to the First Amendment was a talking point. As if anyone up here has any more or less commitment to the constitution than anybody else up here. Let me tell you about my relationship to the First Amendment. It is part of the Constitution that I raised my right hand and swore to defend with my life. That is my experience and it may not be the same as yours, but it counts, senator, it counts."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"I certainly respect your military experience. Thatís not what this is about. This is about choosing a president and I know my view of this is I know you ran for to be chair of the Democratic National Committee. Thatís not something that I wanted to do. I want to be president of the United States. And the point is we should have someone heading up this ticket that has actually won and been able to show that they can gather the support that you talk about of moderate Republicans and Independents as well as a fired-up democratic base. And not just done at once, I have done it three times. I think winning matters. I think a track record of getting things done matters and I also think showing our party that we can actually bring people with us, have a wider tent, have a bigger coalition and yes, longer coattails that matters."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"Iíve got to respond to that. Senator I know that if you just go by vote totals, maybe what goes on in my city seems small to you. If you want to talk about the capacity to win, try putting together a coalition to bring you back to office with 80% of the vote as a gay dude and Mike Penceís Indiana."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,If you had won in Indiana that would be one thing. You tried and you lost by 20 points.
2019-12-19,Sanders,"Letís talk about howÖ Excuse me, letís talk about how we win an election, which is something everybody here wants to do in terms of defeating the most dangerous president in American history. So let me tell you how youíre win it. You have the largest voter turnout in the history of America. And you donít have the largest voter turnout unless you create energy and excitement. And you know, create energy and excitement unless you are prepared to take on the people who own America and are prepared to speak to the people who are working in America. We need a progressive agenda. Medicare for all, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, leading the world in combating climate change, making public colleges and universities-"
2019-12-19,Sanders,available to all because we have free tuition or intensely Oh student debt in this country.
2019-12-19,Warren,"So as Iíve talked about before, I have a 2 cent wealth tax proposed for millionaires and billionaires and that gives us enough money to invest in all of our babies age zero to five. To put an historic $800 billion investment in public schools, K through 12 and that will permit us to offer technical school 2-year college, 4-year college for every single person who wants an education. Cancel student loan debt four 50Ö. Put a $50 billion investment in our historically black colleges and universities and cancel student loan debt for 43 million Americans."
2019-12-19,Warren,"Look, this is about money, but this is also about values. We need to make an investment in our future and the best way to do that is letís invest in the public education of our children. That starts when theyíre babies and it goes long after high school. We want to have families. I meet families every day in the selfie lines who talk about what it means to be crushed by student loan debt. Thatís why I have a proposal, popular among Democrats, popular among Republicans, popular among independents to ask those at the top to pay a little more. So somebody can get rid of that student loan debt so they can make an investment in themselves. Start a small business, buy a car, create a future for themselves and for this country."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"I do think that if youíre in that lucky top 10% I still wish you, well, donít get me wrong, I just want you to go ahead and pay your own tuition. Now we can still have public service loan forgiveness for those who go into lower income fields to deal with that. But if youíre not top 10% I think youíre going to be for the most part. Okay? And there is a very real choice on where every one of these tax dollars goes. So I very much agree with Senator Warren on raising more tax revenue from millionaires and billionaires. I just donít agree on the part about spending it on millionaires and billionaires when it comes to their college tuition."
2019-12-19,Warren,"So wait, he mentioned me by name."
2019-12-19,Warren,"Look, the mayor wants billionaires to pay one tuition for their own kids. I want a billionaire to pay enough to cover tuition for all of our kids because thatís how we build a future. The other part is weíve got to deal with student loan debt, and right now most of the people on the stage are nibbling around the edges of a huge student loan debt burden that disproportionately affects people of color. African Americans are more likely to have to borrow money to go to school, more likely to borrow more money while theyíre in school and have a harder time paying it off. We want to make an investment in the future then open up education for all of our kids. Thatís how we build our future."
2019-12-19,Sanders,"I believe in the concept of universality and one of the crises in America today is people are sick and tired of filling out forms. So youíre not eligible for the program today because youíre at 150 but youíll lost your job by eligible. Youíve got a better job, youíre eligible. I think what we have to do is what we do with social security, what we do with public education. Donald Trumpís kids can go to a public school, they should be able to go to a public school. What we all need right now is a revolution in education. We have got to en this dysfunctional childcare system and make that every working class person in this country can find high quality, affordable childcare. We need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. And by taxing billionaires and by taxing wall street, we will cancel all student debt in this country."
2019-12-19,Steyer,"Look, the United States has made a commitment to treat everybody equally and that means supporting people with disabilities both in terms of education and later when theyíre part of the workforce. That means bringing the resources to bear to make sure that weíre treating them fairly in school and after school to try and integrate them fully and to make them have as full a life as possible."
2019-12-19,Steyer,"The question weíve got here across the board is can we afford to do the kinds of things that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren are pushing? And the answer is yes, but in fact what we need to do is to undo the tax breaks that have been given for two generations to rich Americans and big corporations last year the top 400 corporations paid an 11% tax. That is absolutely ludicrous."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,Could I answer the crisis? [crosstalk 00:38:47]
2019-12-19,Steyer,"the answer on disability is a question of focus and money as so many of these questions are, we have a country where the government is broken because corporations have bought it. Theyíre getting their way and for us to get back to government of by and for the people that serves Americans, including Americans with disabilities. Weíre going to have to take that back. For the sake-"
2019-12-19,Yang,"I would love it. I have a son with special needs and to me special needs is the new normal in this country. How many of you all have a family member or a friend or a neighbor with special needs or autism? If you look around, most hands went up. The fact is right now we have to do more for Kyle. Special needs children are going to become special needs adults in many cases. And hereís the challenge. We go to employers and say, Hey, this special needs person can be a contributor in your workplace, which may be correct, but thatís not the point. We have to stop confusing economic value in human value. We have to be able to say to our kids and Kyle that you have intrinsic value because you are an American and you are a human being."
2019-12-19,Yang,"Weíre going to put a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month in everyoneís hands, which is going to help families around the country adapt and then weíre going to take this burden off of the communities and off of the schools who do not have the resources to support kids like my son and make it a federal priority, not a local one. So not not robbing Peter to pay Paul."
2019-12-19,Warren,No. Come on.
2019-12-19,Warren,"So I was a special education teacher and I loved that work because it gave me a chance to work straight up with people to recognize the worth of every human being. I had four to 46-year-olds who were in special ed and what do we need to do? Thatís why I have a plan as a special ed teacher to fully fund IDEA, so every child with disabilities will get the full education they need."
2019-12-19,Warren,"My housing plan is about investing in more housing across this country and rural America and urban America in small town America, but itís also about making sure that people who want to live independently, people who have disabilities will have housing available to them. I make a part of my job to spill that we are going to make sure as president, I will make sure that the people who want to bid on federal contracts are treating people with disabilities fairly and paying them fairly. Youíve got to go at it at every part of what we do because as a nation, this is truly a measure of who we are. We believe in treating these the least of thy brethren as people of value, and that is how we make a better America."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"Of course. And I want to make it clear that Iíve opposed many, many judges and I think everyone will remember what happened at the Kavanaugh Hearing when that nominee went after me. I stood my ground and he had to apologize. So I have been very strong on these judges. As for the judge you just referred to, there was actually the judge that wrote the opinion was a, that went through the Senate unanimously with support by Senator Sanders with support by President Obama with support by then Senator Kennedy. So I think it is very important when we look at these judges to acknowledge that there are some of these judges that you think are going to be okay and they arenít, but what would I do as president? I would appoint judges that are in the vein of people like Elena Kagan and justice Pryor and Sonia Sotomayor, and letís not forget the notorious RBG. Thatís what I would do."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"And if you look at my record as a lawyer and a member of the Judiciary committee, look at the judges that I recommended to President Obama. People like Mimi Wright whoís a superstar, and Susan Richard Nelson, look at who I put in as the first openly gay Marshall in the history of the United States. I did that because I knew they were qualified people to take those jobs and you need to do it not only with the right judges and have that knowhow, but you also have to do it right away. That is one thing that we all learn from when president Obama was in and that was that he was dealing with an economic crisis and it was hard to do it right away, but we have to immediately start putting judges on the bench to fill vacancies so that we can reverse the horrific nature of these Trump judges."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"The Supreme court is very personal for me because my household, my marriage, exists by the grace of a single vote on that body, and yes, it is critical that we have justices who understand that American freedom includes reproductive rights and reproductive freedom, but thatís not all. I expect an understanding that voting rights are human rights. I expect an understanding that equality is required of us all and I expect a level of respect for the rule of law that prevents this body from coming to be viewed as just one more partisan battlefield, which is why I will not only appoint judges and justices who reflect this worldview, but also begin moving to reform the body itself as our country has done at least half a dozen times in its history. So that it is not one more political battlefield every single time a vacancy comes up."
2019-12-19,Sanders,"We need moral leadership in the white house. We need a president who will do everything humanly possible to end all forms of discrimination against the transgender community, against the African American community, against the Latino community, and against all minorities in this country. But above and beyond providing the moral leadership of trying to bring our people together. What we also need for the transgender community is to make sure that health care is available to every person in this country, regardless of their sexual orientation or their needs. And that is why I strongly support and have helped lead the effort for a Medicare for all single payer program, which will provide comprehensive healthcare to all people, including certainly the transgender community."
2019-12-19,Warren,"The transgender community has been marginalized in every way possible. And one thing that the president of the United States can do is lift up attention, lift up their voices, lift up their lives. Hereís a promise I made. I will go to the Rose Garden once every year to read the names of transgender women of people of color who have been killed in the past year. I will make sure that we read their names so that as a nation we are forced to address the particular vulnerability on homelessness. I will change the rules now that put people in prison based on their birth sex identification rather than their current identification. I will do everything I can to make sure that we are in America that leaves no one behind."
2019-12-19,Biden,"Afghanistan, you said?"
2019-12-19,Biden,[inaudible 00:23:25].
2019-12-19,Biden,"The reason I can speak to this, itís well known, if any of you followed my view on Afghanistan, I was sent by the president before we got sworn in to Afghanistan to come back with a report. I said there was comprehensive policy available and then I got in a big fight for a long time with the Pentagon because I strongly opposed the nation building notion. We set about rebuilding that country as a, as a whole nation is beyond our capacity. I argued from the very beginning that we should have a policy that was based on an anti-terrorism policy with a very small footprint that in fact only had special forces to deal with potential threats from that territory to the United States of America."
2019-12-19,Biden,The first thing I would do as president the United States of America is to make sure that we brought all combat troops home and into a negotiation with the Taliban. But I would leave behind special forces in small numbers to be able to deal with the potential threat unless we got a real good negotiation accomplished to deal with terrorism. Thatís been my position from the beginning. Thatís why I think secretary Gates and some members of the Pentagon werenít happy with me.
2019-12-19,Biden,Since 2009Ö
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"Hard evidence to the contrary, what do you say to that?"
2019-12-19,Biden,"Since 2009 go back and look, I was on the opposite side of that with the Pentagon. [inaudible 00:50:08] I can speak to it now is because itís been published. Itís been published thoroughly. Iím the guy, from the beginning, who argued that it was a big, big mistake to surge forces to Afghanistan, period. We should not have done it and I argued against it constantly."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,Senator Sanders you had your hand up?
2019-12-19,Sanders,"In all due respect to Joe. Joe, youíre also the guy who helped lead us into the disastrous war in Iraq. What we need to do, is I think, rethink and the Washington post piece was very educational. What we need to rethink, is the entire war on terror? We have lost thousands of our own men and women, brave soldiers. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, have been killed abroad or forced to leave their countries. It is time right now, that we bring this world together, to try to end these endless wars and address the root causes, which are causing these wars."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"Senator Sanders, you do often point to your vote against the war in Iraq is evidence of your judgment on foreign policy. But you did vote for the war in Afghanistan and as recently as 2015 you said you supported a continued U. S. Troop presence there. Was that support a mistake?"
2019-12-19,Sanders,"Well, only one person, my good friend Barbara Lee was right on that issue. She was the only person in the house to vote against the war in Afghanistan. She was right, I was wrong. So was everybody else in the house. But to answer your question, I donít think you do what Trump does and make foreign policy decisions based on a tweet at 3:00 AM in the morning or dessert your long time allies like the Kurds. I think you work with the international community, you remove all troops over a period of time, a short period of time within one year."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"Thank you, Senator. Mayor Buttigieg, you served in this war, but I want to ask about your decision making if you were elected Commander in Chief. You have pledged to withdrawal all U.S. troops from a Afghanistan within your first year as president. But the Taliban today control or contest more than half the country. So should you, as president, still withdrawal all those U. S. Troops if the country could once again become a Haven for terrorists."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"Weíre going to leave one way or the other. The question is to make sure we do it well and not poorly. And of course that has to respond to the conditions on the ground and the need for a political settlement. But the other day I was reunited with somebody that I served with over there and the thing we were, marveling at is how long itís been since we left. I thought I was one of the last troops turning out the lights when I left years ago and weíre still there. There may need to be some kind of limited special operations and intelligence capacity. The exact same kind of thing by the way that we actually had in Syria, holding the line before the president yanked it out leading to the road to chaos. But what we know is that we cannot go on with these endless wars."
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"And Iím glad that the name of Barbara Lee was mentioned, not only because of what sheís talked about years ago. I believe that we had no choice but to go to Afghanistan after 9/11 but right now, she is one of the leaders of the effort to repeal and replace the authorization for the use of military force and the folks that I served with deserve that. They deserve the clarity of members of Congress being able to summon the courage, to take an up or down vote on whether they ought to be there in the first place and when I am president, anytime if I am forced to deploy troops into war, anytime we seek an authorization, it will have a three year sunset. So that if there really does have to be a conversation about extending it, it has to be brought to Congress, brought to the American people, and those members of Congress have to take that tough up or down vote."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,Thank you Mr mayor. Tim.
2019-12-19,Sanders,"Well Tim, at a time when weíre spending twice as much per capita on healthcare as any other nation. When 87 million people are uninsured or under insured. When 30,000 people are dying each year because they donít get to a doctor when they should and what a half a million people are going bankrupt because of the dysfunctional and cruel system that we currently have. You know what? I think we will pass a Medicare for all, single payer system."
2019-12-19,Sanders,"And I will introduce that legislation in my first week in office. Now to answer your question, I think when we go out to the American people and tell them, that right now, we have got to take on the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry, for example. Which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same exact drug as itís charged in this country. Where the American people understand that Medicare for all expands Medicare to cover home health care, dental care, eyeglasses, and hearing AIDS and does it at a cost far, far lower than what some of my opponents are talking about. You know what? Weíre going to have the American people behind us. We will have Congress behind it."
2019-12-19,Biden,"I donít think it is realistic, but let me explain why. I introduced a plan to build on Obamacare. It remind everybody, 20 million people got insurance, didnít have it before. All people with preexisting conditions are able to be covered. I could go on. We didnít get all that we wanted, but now that itís been exposed, that taking it away has such dire consequences. Iíve added to the Obamacare plan, the Biden Initiative, which is a public option. Medicare, if you want to have Medicare.for reducing significantly the price of drugs, deductibles, et cetera by underwriting the plan to a tune of about $750 billion dollars. And making sure that weíre able to cover everyone who is in fact able to be covered. It, put your hand down for a second Bernie. Okay."
2019-12-19,Sanders,Just Waving to you Joe.
2019-12-19,Biden,"I know. So look, it covers everybody. Itís realistic and most importantly, it lets you choose what you want. Here you have 160 million people have negotiated their healthcare plans with their employer. Like many of you had. You may or may not like it. If you donít like it, you can move into the public option that I proposed in my plan. But if you like it, you shouldnít have Washington dictating you. You can not keep the plan you have. Thatís a funÖ"
2019-12-19,Sanders,"Under Joeís plan essentially, we retain the status quo."
2019-12-19,Biden,Thatís not true. [crosstalk 00:57:46]
2019-12-19,Sanders,"That is exactly true. Thank you. And by the way, Joe, under your plan, you asked me how are we going to pay for it? Under your plan Iíll tell you how weíre paying for right now. The average worker in America, their family makes 60,000 a year. That family is now paying $12,000 a year for health care. 20% of the income or the Medicare for all that family will be paying $1,200 a year because weíre eliminating the profiteering of the drug companies and the insurance companies and ending, thereís Byzantine and complex administration of thousands of separate healthcare plans."
2019-12-19,Biden,"Iím the only guy thatís not interrupted here. All right, Iím going to interrupt now. It costs 30 trillion dollars. Letís get that straight. $30 trillion over 10 years. Some say it costs 20 trillion. Some say it cost 40. The idea that youíre going to be able to save that person making $60,000 a year on Medicare for all is absolutely preposterous. 16% of the American public is on Medicare now and everybody has a tax taken out of their paycheck now. Tell me, youíre going to add 84% more and itís not going to be higher taxes, at least before he was honest about it. Itís going to increase personal taxes. Theyíre going to beÖ"
2019-12-19,Sanders,"Thatís right. We all got to increase personal taxes, but weíre eliminating premiums, weíre eliminating copayments, weíre eliminating deductibles, weíre eliminating all out of pocket expenses and no family in America will spend more than $200 a year on prescription drugs. [crosstalk 00:09:41]"
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,HeyÖ
2019-12-19,Sanders,Itís first time I did this.
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"Okay, thatís true. Iíll say this. First of all, Bernie, I promise when I am your president, I will get our pharmaceutical bills done and we have worked together on this time and time again and I agree with you on that. But where I disagree is, I just donít think anyone has a monopoly on bold ideas. I think you can be progressive and practical at the same time. That is why I favor a public option, which is a nonprofit option to bring the cost down and yes, it does bring the cost down immediately for 13 million people and then weíll expand coverage to 12 million people."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"But hereís the political problem. This fight that you guys are having isnít real. Your fight, Bernie is not with me or with Vice President Biden. It is with all those, bunch of those new house members. Not everyone by any means, that got elected in that last election in the democratic party. It is with the new governor, democratic governor of Kentucky that wants to build on Obamacare. And the way I look at it, if you want to cross a river over some trouble waters, you build a bridge, you donít blow one up. And I think we should build on the affordable care act. [crosstalk 00:01:01:01]"
2019-12-19,Sanders,She took my name in vain. She hurt my feelings. [crosstalk 01:01:09]
2019-12-19,Sanders,"All right. My fight, Amy, itís not with the governor of Kentucky. My fight and all of our fights must be with the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry. With the greed and corruption of the insurance industry. These guys last year made $100 billion in profit and tens of millions of Americans cannot afford to go to a doctor tonight. The day has got to come and Joe is not talking about it. Amy is not talking about it. The day has got to come and I will bring that day about what we finally say that the drug companies and the insurance companies, the function of health care is that provided for all of our people in a cost effective way, not to make massive profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies. [crosstalk 01:02:06]"
2019-12-19,Warren,"So this is about costs. Itís about costs on middle class families. Last year, 36 million Americans didnít have a prescription filled because they couldnít afford it. And those are people with health insurance as well. People who canít do the copays, people who canít do the deductibles. People who find out that the drug is not covered. So hereís how I approach this. I want to do the most good I can for the most people as quickly as possible. On day one, Iím going to attack the prices on commonly used drugs like Epipens and insulin and bring down those prices."
2019-12-19,Warren,"The president can do that. I love saying this all by herself and I will do it. Thatís going to save families hundreds of millions of dollars and then in the first hundred days, because I found a way to pay for full healthcare coverage for everyone, without raising taxes on middle class families. Iím going to make available to people for a full healthcare coverage for 135 million people. Itíll be at no cost at all and they can opt into that system. For others. It will be at a low cost. We have got to start moving and move fast [crosstalk 00:01:03:36] and do that. We can do that on 50 votes."
2019-12-19,Yang,Wow.
2019-12-19,Warren,We can do a labor action and just all go on strike on this one Andrew.
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"Well, first of all, I love data and books, so I think we should all be excited about this. And come to think of it, I should probably send my book around more to. Look. I think all of us want the same thing at the end of the day. We know what a gift it would be to the future and to the country for literally anybody up here to become president of The United States compared to what weíve got. And we got to remember there. I donít know how many, now weíre up to 25 something, have run for president in the democratic party. The moment weíve got a nominee, the 24 who arenít that nominee are going to have to rally around the one who does. Letís make sure thereís not too much to ask for forgiveness for by the time that day comes."
2019-12-19,Warren,"I will ask for forgiveness. I know that sometimes I get really worked up and sometimes I get a little hot. I donít really mean to. What happens is when you do 100,000 selfies with people you hear enough stories about people who are really down to their last moments. I met someone just last week in Nevada, who said that he has diabetes and that he has access to a prescription because heís a veteran. But his sister has diabetes, his daughter has diabetes, and they simply canít afford insulin. So the three of them spend all of their time figuring out how to stretch one insulin prescription among three people. When I think about what we could do if we get a majority in the house, a majority in the Senate, and get back the white house, we could make this country work for people like that man. And thatís why Iím in this fight."
2019-12-19,Warren,"I think everyone up here on this stage, and those are not on the stage whoíve run, we owe them because theyíre all pushing for the same exact thing. Youíre not the only one that does Senator. Iíve done thousands of them. And the crew that follows me can tell you thereís not one line I go through. I donít have at least to have a dozen people come up and hug me and say, can you help me? I just lost my daughter 10 days ago. Can you help me? Tell me am I going to be okay? Can you help me? I just lost [inaudible] and theyíd go and lay out their problems. My wife and I have a call list of somewhere between 20 and a hundred people that we call at least every week or every month to tell them Iím here."
2019-12-19,Warren,"I give them my private phone number. They keep in touch with me. A little kid who says, (stuttering) I canít talk. What do I do? I have scores of these young women and men who I keep in contact with. And the reason I would give everyone here at gift is because they want to do something like I do, of making their lives better because thereís a lot of people who are hurting very, very, very badly."
2019-12-19,Sanders,"Well, I can give out any one of four books that I wrote. But I think the gift that all of us need to give to the American people is a very different vision of the reality of the Trump administration. And the vision that we need to bring forth, is to create a government and a nation based on love and compassion, not greed and hatred. We need a vision which says that in our great country, all of our people should be able to earn a decent standard of living, have health care, have the ability to send their kids to college regardless of their income. So we need a new vision, which brings our people together. Around an agenda that works for all, not the Trump vision of dividing us up to benefit the billionaire class. Thatís my vision."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"Well, Iíd ask for forgiveness anytime any of you get mad at me. I can be blunt, but I am doing this because I think it is so important to pick the right candidate here. I do. I think when you see whatís going on around the country, yes, itís the economic check that Elizabeth and Bernie have so well pointed out on this stage, but thereís something else going on here and it is a decency check. It is a values check. It is a patriotism check. When you see people, and weíve all had this happen, that come to our meetings and say yeah, I voted for Donald Trump but I donít want to do it again because I want my kids to be able to watch the president on TV and not mute the TV. We have to remember as Democrats, and if I get worked up about this, itís because I believe itís so much in my heart, that we have to bring people with us and not shut them out. That is the gift we can give America in this election."
2019-12-19,Steyer,"So, look, this is the holiday season and what Iím hearing from every single one of these candidates is that theyíve gone around the United States and what theyíve seen from this administration and what theyíve seen from the Republican party is cruelty towards the people of the United States for money. So when I think about the gift that Iíd like to give, and Iíve seen that too. I mean I think it starts with cruelty. When children are born and it goes right through life into pre-K, education, health care, a living wage, there is cruelty to working people, thereís cruelty to seniors."
2019-12-19,Steyer,"And so the gift that Iíd like to give everyone on this stage, which was the original question, is the gift of teamwork. Because the question up here is, how are we together going to change this framework? How are we together, going to beat this corrupt and criminal president? How are we going to stand up for the people of the United States together? Not by tearing each other down, but by supporting each other and by realizing that what we stand for is the true value of America. And as a team thatís how weíre going to do it. And as Americans, weíre going to come together to stand up for the original values, freedom, equality, justice, teamwork."
2019-12-19,Steyer,"Iím different from everybody else on this stage and hereís why, Iím running because corporations have bought our government and we need to return power to the people. And for the last 10 years, thatís exactly what Iíve been doing, taking on unchecked corporate power. Thatís why Iím for term limits, because if weíre going to have bold change, then we need new people in charge and new ideas. Iím the only person on this stage whoís built a large, multi billion dollar international business. I know how to grow prosperity. I can take on Mr. Trump on the economy and beat him. Iím the only one on this stage who said climate is my number one priority. Itís a crisis we have to deal with, but itís also our greatest opportunity to create millions of good paying union jobs across the country and clean up the air and water and the black and brown communities where itís so essential. So if you want to break the corporate stranglehold, beat Mr. Trump on the economy and solve our climate crisis. I can deliver-"
2019-12-19,Steyer,and Iím asking for your vote.
2019-12-19,Yang,"I know what youíre thinking. America, how am I still on this stage with them? [crosstalk 00:01:31]"
2019-12-19,Yang,"Our campaign is growing all the time because we are laser focused on solving the real problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place. I spent seven years helping create thousands of jobs in Detroit, Baltimore, New Orleans and other cities, serving as an ambassador of entrepreneurship under President Obama, and I saw firsthand what many of you already know, our country is falling apart. Our senior citizens are working until the day they die. Our kids are addicted to smartphones or drugs. Weíre seeing record high levels of depression, suicides, overdoses. Our companies are recording record profits while our people are literally dying younger. Our way of life is changing faster than ever. And the simple fact is this, our politicians in D C succeed whether we the people succeed or fail. Washington DC today is the richest city in our country. What do they produce? Bad decisions? We need to get the money out of DC and into your hands, the hands of the American people. Join us in Yang2020.com and help us rewrite the rules of the 20th century economy to work for us."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"We have had quite a debate tonight, but I want to debate Donald Trump. This primary comes down to some simple questions. Who has the best ideas, the best experience, mostly, who can beat Donald Trump and how will she do it? So Donald Trump built his fortune on over time, over $413 million that he got from his Dad. My Grandpa, he was an iron ore miner, a union member who worked 1500 feet underground, and he saved money in a coffee can in the basement to send my Dad to a community college. Thatís my family trust."
2019-12-19,Klobuchar,"And I figure if you are given opportunity, you donít go into the world with a sense of entitlement. You go into it with a sense of obligation. An obligation to lift people up instead of hoarding what you have for yourself. Our politics right now because of Donald Trump are toxic. We need a leader who can bring people together and who can win that way. So if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me. If you want a bigger tent and a wider coalition and longer coattails, join me. We will win at amyklobuchar.com"
2019-12-19,Buttigieg,"So the nominee is going to have to do two things, defeat Donald Trump, and unite the country as president. Itís a tall order. And in order to do it, weíre going to need a nominee and a president who can respond to the crisis of belonging that is gripping our nation today. That means building up a politics that is defined, not by who we exclude, not by who we reject, but by how many people we can call to this side. I have seen so many people capable of forming that multiracial, multi generational coalition and Iím seeing more and more people who maybe have not felt welcome in the Democratic party before, but belong here now, because theyíre definitely not on board with whatís going on in the Trump white house. I am asking you to join me, to vote for me to caucus for me and to help us build that future defined not by exclusion but by belonging."
2019-12-19,Warren,"Did you call my name? This is a dark moment in America and yet I come here tonight with a heart filled with hope. All three of my brothers served in the military. Theyíre all retired. Theyíre all back in Oklahoma. One is a Democrat, two are Republicans. But you know what unites my three brothers Amazon, they are furious that Amazon reported $10 billion in profits and paid zero in taxes. My brothers are part of why is ready to root out corruption and fight back, and that gives us a base to work from. America is ready for 2 cent wealth tax. Itís supported by Republicans, Democrats and Independents, and it lets us invest in all of our children."
2019-12-19,Warren,"America is ready to expand social security payments and disability payments by $200 a month and we can do it. You know, someone asks what this would mean, you just give somebody $200 a month. They asked me this in a town hall, and a lady who wanted it said, ìyou know what it will mean to me. Itíll mean I can get a prescription filled, and I can still buy toilet paper this same week.î Thatís where Americans are right now. I am not working for millionaires and billionaires. Iím here to work for the tens of millions of people across this country who are ready to build an America that wonít just work those at the top, but that will work for everyone."
2019-12-19,Sanders,"45 years, Americans have been listening to great speeches, and at the end of the day, the average American worker is not making a nickel more than he or she did in real wages, over those 45 years. The truth is that real change always takes place. Real change always takes place from the bottom on up, never from the top on down. And that is why in this campaign, I am so proud that we have over a million volunteers. We have some of the strongest grassroots organizations. We have raised more individual contributions than any candidate in American history. Please join the political revolution @berniesanders.com. Letís defeat Trump. Letís transform this country. Thank you."
2019-12-19,Biden,"Thank you very much for listening, seven days out, Christmas. Thank you very much. Look, we all have big progressive plans and the question is, who can deliver on those plans? And it seems to me we have to ask ourselves three questions straight up and honestly. Who has the best chance, most likely chance of defeating Donald Trump? Who is the one whoís most likely to do that? Number two, who can help elect Democrats to the United States Senate, in States like North Carolina and Georgia and Arizona and other States."
2019-12-19,Biden,"And thirdly, who can deliver legislatively? That requires you to look at our records. I have a significant record of getting significant things done from the Violence Against Women Act and the Chemical Weapons Treaty in foreign and domestic policy alike. And so I think asking those questions, I believe, as you expect, that Iím the most qualified to answer those three questions. But most of all, weíve got to level with the American people. Donít play games with them, tell them the truth and be authentic. God bless you all and may you all have a great, great holiday season and thank you guys for doing this as well."
2019-11-20,Warren,"Of course I will. And the obvious answer is to say, first read the Mueller Report, all 442 pages of it, that showed how the president tried to obstruct justice, and when Congress failed to act at that moment, and that the president felt free to break the law again and again and again. And thatís whatís happened with Ukraine. We have to establish the principle, no one is above the law. We have a constitutional responsibility, and we need to meet it. But I want to add one more part based on todayís testimony, and that is, how did Ambassador Sondland get there? This is not a man who had any qualifications except one. He wrote a check a million dollars, and that tells us about whatís happening in Washington."
2019-11-20,Warren,"The corruption, how money buys its way into Washington. You know, I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think theyíre going to get ambassadorships on the other side. And Iíve taken a pledge. Anyone who wants to give me a big donation, donít ask to be an ambassador, because Iím not going to have that happen. I asked everyone whoís running for president to join me in that, and not a single person has so far. I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say, we are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder."
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"I have made it very clear that this is impeachable conduct, and Iíve called for an impeachment proceeding. I just believe our job as jurors is to look at each count, and make a decision. But let me make very clear that what this impeachment proceeding about is really our democracy at stake. This is a president that not only with regard to his conduct with Ukraine, but every step of the way puts his own private interests, his own partisan interests, his own political interests in front of our countryís interest. And this is wrong. This is a pattern with this man, and it goes to everything from how he has betrayed our farmers, and our workers, to what he has done with foreign affairs, leaving the Kurds for slaughter, sucking up to Vladimir Putin every minute of the day."
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"That is what this guy does. And I think it is very, very important that we have a president thatís going to put our country first. I was thinking about this when I was at the Carter Presidential Museum, and on the wall are etched the words of Walter Mondale when he looked back at their four years, not perfect, and he said this, ìWe told the truth. We obey the law. We kept the peace.î We told the truth, we obeyed the law. We kept the peace. That is the minimum that we should expect in a President of the United States."
2019-11-20,Sanders,"Well, Rachel, sadly, we have a president who is not only a pathological liar, he is likely the most corrupt president in the modern history of America. But we cannot simply be consumed by Donald Trump, because if we are, you know what? Weíre going to lose the election. Right now, youíve got 87 million people who have no health insurance, or under-insured. We are facing the great existential crisis about time in terms of climate change. You got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street, and you got 18 million people paying half of their limited incomes for housing. What the American people understand is that the Congress can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time. In other words, we can deal with Trumpís corruption, but we also have to stand up for the working families of this country. We also have to stand up to the fact that our political system is corrupt, dominated by a handful of billionaires, and that our economy is rigged with three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of America. We can do it all when we rally the American people in the cause of justice."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"Well, the constitutional process of impeachment should be beyond politics, and it is not a part of the campaign, but the presidentís conduct is. The impeachable conduct that we have seen, in the abuse of power that weíre learning more about in the investigations. But just to be clear, the presidentís already confessed to it on television, but thatís just part of what weíve seen. Under normal circumstances, a president would leave office after something that was revealed recently that barely got any attention at all, which was the president had to confess, in writing, in court, to illegally diverting charitable contributions that were supposed to go to veterans. We are absolutely going to confront this president for his wrongdoing, but we are also each running to be the president who will lead this country after the Trump Presidency comes to an end, one way or the other."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"Iím running to be the president for that day the sun comes up, and the Trump Presidency is behind us, which will be a tender moment in the life of this country. And we are going to have to unify a nation that will be as divided as ever, and while doing it, address big issues that didnít take a vacation for the impeachment process, or for the Trump Presidency as a whole, a climate approaching the point of no return. The fact that weíve still got to act on healthcare, kids learning active shooter drills before they learn to read, and an economy where even when the Dow Jones is looking good, far too many Americans have to fight like hell just to hold onto what theyíve got."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"Those are the crises that will be awaiting the next president, and will be at the heart of our campaign."
2019-11-20,Biden,"Well, look, the next President of the United States is going to have to do two things. Defeat Donald Trump, thatís number one. And number two, going to have to be able to go into states like Georgia and North Carolina and other places, and get a Senate majority. Thatís what Iíll do. You have to ask yourself up here, who is most likely to be able to win the nomination in the first place, to win the presidency in the first place. And secondly, who is most likely to increase the number of people who are Democrats in the house, and in the Senate? And by the way, I learned something about these impeachment trials. I learned number one, that Donald Trump doesnít want me to be the nominee. Thatís pretty clear."
2019-11-20,Biden,"He held up aid to make sure that while at the same time innocent people in [inaudible 00:08:11] are getting killed by Russian soldiers. Secondly, I found out that Vladimir Putin doesnít want me to be president. So Iíve learned a lot about these things early on from these hearings that are being held. But the bottom line is, I think we have to ask ourselves the honest question, who is most likely to do what needs to be done? Produce a democratic majority in the United States Senate, maintain the House, and beat Trump?"
2019-11-20,Harris,"Well first of all, we have a criminal living in the White House, and there is no question that in 2020, the biggest issue before us, until we get to that tender moment is justice is on the ballot. And what we saw today is Ambassador Sondland, by his own words told us that everyone was in the loop. That means it is a criminal enterprise engaged in by the President, from what we heard today, the Vice President, the Secretary of State and the Chief of Staff. And so this not only points to the corrupt nature of this administration and the need for these impeachment proceedings to go forward, but it also points to another issue."
2019-11-20,Harris,"And back to the question that you asked earlier, which is what does this mean for the American people? Because what it means when I watch this, is that there are clearly two different set of rules for two different groups of people in America. The powerful people, who with their arrogance think they can get away with this, and then everybody else. Because hereís the thing. For those working people who are working two and three jobs, if they donít pay that credit card by the end of the month, they get a penalty. For the people who donít pay their rent, they get evicted. For the people who shoplift, they go to jail. We need the same set of rules for everybody, and part of the reason Iím running for president is to say that we have to bring justice back to America for all people. And not just for some."
2019-11-20,Warren,"So I think the way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is we talk about the things that unite us. And that is, that we want to build an America that works for the people, not one that just works for rich folks. You know, I have proposed a two cent wealth tax. That is a tax for everybody who has more than 50 billion dollars in assets. Your first 50 billion is free and clear. But your 50 billionth and first dollar, got to pitch in 2 cents. And when you hit a billion dollars, youíve got to pitch in a few pennies more. Hereís the thing, doing a wealth tax is not about punishing anyone. Itís about saying you built something great in this country, good for you. But you did it using workers. All of us help pay to educate. You did it using, youíre getting your goods to on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You did it protected by police and firefighters, all of us help pay the salaries for."
2019-11-20,Warren,"So when you make it big, when you make it really big, when you make it top one 10th of 1% big, pitch in 2 cents, so everybody else gets a chance to make it. And hereís the thing, thatís something that Democrats care about, independents care about, and Republicans care about. Because regardless of party affiliation, people understand across this country, our government is working better and better for the billionaires, for the rich, for the well-connected, and worse and worse for everyone else. We come together when we acknowledge that and [crosstalk 00:11:50] real change."
2019-11-20,Booker,"Well, first of all, I think we all agree that we need to bring in a lot more revenue in this country. We actually have a real problem with the tax rates, tax loopholes, tax cheats, and I donít agree with the wealth tax the way that Elizabeth Warren puts it, but I agree that we need to raise the estate tax. We need to tax capital gains as ordinary income. Real strategies will increase revenue. But hereís the challenge. We as Democrats need to fight for a just taxation system. But as I travel around the country, we Democrats also have to talk about how to grow wealth as well."
2019-11-20,Booker,"When I stood in church recently, and asked folks in a black church, how many people here want to be entrepreneurs? Half the church raised their hands. If we as a country donít start, if we as a party, donít start talking, not just about how to tax wealth, but to give more people opportunities to create wealth, to grow businesses, to have their American dream. Because yeah, we need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, $15 an hour. But the people in communities I frequent, theyíre not aspiration for their lives is not just to have those fair wages. They want to have an economy that provides not just equalities in wealth, but they want to have equalities of opportunity. And thatís what our party has to be about as well."
2019-11-20,Warren,"Sure. So let me just tell you what we can do with that two cent wealth tax. Two cents on the top one 10th of 1% in this country, and we can provide universal childcare for every baby in this country age zero to five. That is transformative. We can provide universal pre-K for every three-year-old and four-year-old in America. We can stop exploiting the women, largely black and brown women who do this work, and we can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America. We can put 800 billion new federal dollars into all of our public schools. We can make college tuition free for every kid. We can put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities, and we can cancel student loan debt for 95% of the folks whoíve got it. Two cent wealth tax and we can invest in an entire generationís future."
2019-11-20,Warren,Sure.
2019-11-20,Booker,"You know, again, I agree with the need to do all of those things. Weíre all united in wanting to see universal preschool, and Iíll fight for that. Weíre all united in wanting to fund HBCUs. Heck, I wouldnít be here if it wasnít for two parents that went to HBCUs. But the tax, the way weíre putting the forward right now, the wealth tax, Iím sorry, itís cumbersome. Itís been tried by other nations. Itís hard to evaluate. We can get the same amount of revenue through just taxation. But again, we as Democrats have got to start talking, not just about how we tax from a stage, but how we grow wealth in this country amongst those disadvantaged communities that are not seeing it."
2019-11-20,Booker,"Look at VC dollars in this country. 75% of them go to the three metropolitan areas. There is worth in the inner city. There is value in our rural areas. If I am President of the United States, weíre going to have a fair just taxation where millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share, but dear God, weíre going to have pathways to prosperity for more Americans. Weíre going to see a change in what we see right now. Small businesses, new startups are going down in this country."
2019-11-20,Booker,We need to give more new entrepreneurs access to wealth.
2019-11-20,Warren,"So, just the idea behind what is fair, today the 99% in America are on track to pay about 7.2% of their total wealth in taxes."
2019-11-20,Booker,Iím not disagreeing with that.
2019-11-20,Warren,"The top one 10th of 1% that I want to say pay two cents more, theyíll pay 3.2% in America. Iím tired of freeloading billionaires. I think itís time that we ask those at the very top to pay more, so that every single one of our children gets-"
2019-11-20,Booker,"But everybody is tired of freeloading billionaires. Everybodyís tired of corporations paying zero taxes, Iím not disagreeing with that."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"Well, as President Obama commented recently, we are now in a different reality than we were even 12 years ago. And to me, the extraordinary potential of the moment weíre in right now is that there is an American majority that stands ready to tackle big issues, that didnít exist in the same way even a few years ago. Even on issues where Democrats have been on defense, like immigration, and guns, we have a majority to do the right thing. If we can galvanize, not polarize that majority. For example, on healthcare."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"The reason I insist on Medicare for all who want it as the strategy to deliver on that goal we share of universal healthcare, is that that is something that as a governing strategy, we can unify the American people around. Creating a version of Medicare, making it available to anybody who wants it, but without the divisive step of ordering people onto it whether they want to or not. And I believe that commanding people to accept that option, whether we wait three years as Senator Warren has proposed or whether you do it right out of the gate, is not the right approach to unify the American people around a very, very big transformation that we now have an opportunity to deliver."
2019-11-20,Warren,"I look out and I see tens of millions of Americans who are struggling to pay their medical bills, 37 million people who decided not to have a prescription filled because they just canít afford it. People didnít take the test the doctor recommended because they just canít afford it. So here is my plan. Letís bring as many people in and get as much help to the American people as we can, as fast as we can. On day one, as president, I will do, bring down the cost of prescription drugs on things like insulin and EpiPens. Thatís going to save tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars for people."
2019-11-20,Warren,"Iím going to defend the Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the Trump Administration. And in the first hundred days, Iím going to bring in 135 million people into Medicare for all at no cost to them. Everybody under the age of 18, everybody who has a family of four, income less than $50,000. Iím going to lower the age of Medicare to 50 and expand Medicare coverage to include vision and dental and longterm care. And then in the third year when people have had a chance to feel it, and taste it and live with it, weíre going to vote, and weíre going to want Medicare for all."
2019-11-20,Sanders,"Thank you, I wrote the damn bill."
2019-11-20,Sanders,"No, heís right. We donít have to tear down the system, but we do have to do what the American people want. And the American people understand today that the current healthcare system is not only cruel, it is dysfunctional. Now you tell me how we have a system in which we spend twice as much as do the people of any other country, and yet we got 87 million uninsured, underinsured, in some cases we pay 10 times more for prescription drugs as do the people of Canada, or other countries. 500, 000 people go bankrupt because of medically-related issues, they come down with cancer, and thatís a reason to go bankrupt?"
2019-11-20,Sanders,"Now, some of the people up here think that we should not take on the insurance industry. We should not take on the pharmaceutical industry. But you know what? If you think back to FDR, and if you think to JFK, and Harry Truman, and Barack Obama, as a matter of fact, people have been talking about healthcare for all. Well, you know what? I think now is the time. And in the first week of my administration, we will introduce Medicare for all, Medicare for all, that means no deductibles, no copayments, no out-of-pocket expenses. Thatís where we got to go."
2019-11-20,Biden,"You know, we can do this without charging people raising 30, 40 trillion dollars. The fact is that right now the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare for all. It couldnít pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats. It couldnít pass the House. Nancy Pelosi is one of those people who thinks it makes sense. We should build on Obamacare, provide the plan I put forward before anybody in here, adding a Medicare option in that plan, and not make people choose. Allow people to choose I should say. If you go the route of my two friends on my right and my left, you have to give up your private insurance. 160 million people like their private insurance, and if they donít like it, they can buy into a Medicare-like proposal. In my plan, drug prices go down, premiums go down across the board. But hereís the deal. They get to choose. I trust the American people to make a judgment what they believe is in their interest, and not demand of them what the insurance companies, they want no competition, and my friends say you have to only go Medicare for all."
2019-11-20,Gabbard,"That our democratic party unfortunately is not the party that is of, by, and for the people. It is a party that has been and continues to be influenced by the foreign policy establishment in Washington, represented by Hillary Clinton and others foreign policy, by the military industrial complex, and other greedy corporate interests. Iím running for president to be the democratic nominee that rebuilds our democratic party, takes it out of their hands and truly puts it in the hands of the people of this country. A party that actually hears the voices of Americans who are struggling all across this country, and puts it in the hands of veterans and fellow Americans who were calling for an end to this ongoing Bush, Clinton, Trump, foreign policy, doctrine of regime change wars, overthrowing dictators in other countries, needlessly sending my brothers and sisters in uniform into harmís way to fight in wars that actually undermine our national security, and have cost us thousands of American lives."
2019-11-20,Gabbard,"These are Wars that have cost us as American taxpayers, trillions of dollars since 9/11 alone, dollars that have come out of our pockets, out of our hospitals, out of our schools, out of our infrastructure needs. As president, I will end this foreign policy, end these regime change wars, work to end this new cold war and arms race, and instead invest our hard earned taxpayer dollars actually into serving needs of the American people right here at home."
2019-11-20,Harris,"Oh, sure. I think that itís unfortunate that we have someone on the stage who is attempting to be the democratic nominee for President of the United States, who during the Obama administration spent four years, full-time on Fox news criticizing President Obama."
2019-11-20,Gabbard,Thatís ridiculous Senator Harris.
2019-11-20,Harris,"Who had spent full-time criticizing people on this stage, as affiliated with the democratic party, when Donald Trump was elected, not even sworn in, buddied up to Steve Bannon to get a meeting with Donald Trump in the Trump Tower, fails to call a war criminal by what he is as a war criminal, and then spends full time during the course of this campaign, again, criticizing the democratic party. What we need on the stage on the November is someone who has the ability to win, and by that we need someone on that stage who has the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump, and someone who has the ability to rebuild the Obama coalition, and bring the party and the nation together, I believe I am that candidate."
2019-11-20,Gabbard,"What Senator Harris is doing is unfortunately continuing to traffic in lies and smears and innuendos because she cannot challenge the substance of the argument that Iím making the leadership and the change that Iím seeking to bring in our foreign policy, which only makes me guess that she will, as president, continue the status quo. Continue the Bush/Clinton/ Trump foreign policy of regime change wars, which is deeply destructive. This is personal to me, because I served in Iraq. I left my seat in the state legislature in Hawaii, volunteered to deploy to Iraq where I served in a medical unit where every single day I saw the terribly high human cost of war. I take very seriously the responsibility that the president has to serve as Commander in Chief, to lead our armed forces, and to make sure always, no, Iím not going to put party interests first. I will put the interests of the American people above all else."
2019-11-20,Harris,"I believe that what our nation needs right now is a nominee who can speak to all people. I spent my entire career standing mostly in a courtroom, speaking five words, Kamala Harris for the people. And it was about all the people, regardless of their race, regardless of their gender, regardless of where they live geographically, regardless of the party with which theyíre registered to vote, or the language their grandmother speaks. We need someone on this debate stage in November who has the ability to unify the country, and to win the election, and I believe again, I am that candidate."
2019-11-20,Harris,Thank you.
2019-11-20,Steyer,"What Iíve done over the last decade is to put together coalitions of ordinary American citizens to take on unchecked corporate power. We have a broken government in Washington DC. Itís been purchased by corporations. Over the last decade, with the help of the American people, we have taken on and beaten the oil companies, we have taken on and beaten the tobacco companies, weíve taken on and beaten utilities, weíve taken on and beaten the drug companies. Iíve also built one of the largest grassroots organizations in the United States. Last year, NextGen America did the largest youth voter mobilization in American history."
2019-11-20,Steyer,"I also, in partnership with seven national unions, knocked on 15 million doors in 2016, and 10 million in 2018. What Iíve done is to try to push power down to the American people, to take power away from the corporations whoíve bought our government. And Iím talking now about structural reform in Washington DC. Term limits. If you want bold change in the United States, youíre going to have to have new and different people in charge. Iím the only person on this stage who will talk about term limits. Vice President Biden wonít. Senator Sanders wonít, even Mayor Pete Buttigieg will not talk about term limits and structural change. I would let the American people pass laws themselves through direct democracy. Itís time to push the power back to the people-"
2019-11-20,Steyer,And away from DC.
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"Well, Iím someone that doesnít come from money and I appreciate the work of Mr. Steyer, but right now we have a system thatís not fair. And itís not just fair for money, and so what I would do is start a constitutional amendment, and pass it to overturn Citizens United. Thatís what we should do so that we stop this dark money and outside money from coming into our politics. I have led the way on voting, and I can tell you right now, one solution that would make a huge difference in this state would be allow every kid in the country to register to vote when they turn 18. If we had a system like this, and we did something about gerrymandering, and we stopped the voting purges, and we did something significant about making sure we donít have money in politics from the outside, Stacey Abrams would be governor of this state right now."
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"And thatís what should have happened. So while I appreciate his work, I am someone that doesnít come from money. I see my husband out there, my first Senate race, I literally called everyone I knew and I set what is still an all-time Senate record. I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends. And Iíd like to point out, it is not an expanding base. So I donít just think this with my head, I feel it in my heart."
2019-11-20,Steyer,"Since I was named, Iíd like to chime in here."
2019-11-20,Yang,"Well first, I just want to stick up for Tom. We have a broken campaign finance system, but Tom has been spending his own money fighting climate change, and you canít knock someone for having money and spending it in the right way, my opinion."
2019-11-20,Steyer,Thanks Andrew.
2019-11-20,Yang,"Yeah, no problem. As Commander in Chief, I think we need to be focused on the real threats of the 21st century. And what are those threats? Climate change, artificial intelligence, loose nuclear material, military drones, and non-state actors. And if you look up, weíre in the process of potentially losing the AI arms race to China right now. Because they have more access to more data than we do, and their government is putting billions of dollars to work subsidizing the development of AI in a way that we are not. We are 24 years behind on technology, and I can say that with authority, because we got rid of the Office of Technology Assessment in 1995. Think about that timing. I guess they thought theyíd invented everything. The next Commander in Chief has to be focused on the true threats of tomorrow, and thatís what Iíll bring to the table as commander in chief."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"Because I have the right experience to take on Donald Trump. I get that itís not traditional establishment Washington experience, but I would argue we need something very different right now. In order to defeat this president, we need somebody who can go toe to toe who actually comes from the kinds of communities that heís been appealing to. I donít talk a big game about helping the working class while helicoptering between golf courses with my name on them. I donít even golf. As a matter of fact, I never thought Iíd be on a Forbes Magazine list, but they did one of all the candidates by wealth, and I am literally the least wealthy person on this stage. I also wore the uniform of this country, and know what is at stake in the decisions that are made in the Oval Office, in The Situation Room. And I know how to bring people together to get things done."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"I know that from the perspective of Washington, what goes on in my city might look small, but frankly where we live, the infighting on Capitol Hill is what looks small. The usual way of doing business in Washington is what looks small, and I believe we to send somebody in who has a different kind of experience, the experience on the ground, solving problems, working side by side with neighbors on some of the toughest issues that come up in government. Recognizing what is required of executive leadership, and bringing that to Washington so that Washington can start looking a little more like our best run communities in the Heartland, before the other way around starts to happen."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,ÖCommunities in the Heartland before the other.
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"First of all, Iíve made very clear, I think that Pete is qualified to be up on this stage and I am honored to be standing next to him. But what I said was true. Women are held to a higher standard, otherwise we could play a game called name your favorite woman president, which we canít do because it has all been men and including all vice presidents being men and I think any working woman out there, any woman thatís at home knows exactly what I mean."
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"We have to work harder and thatís a fact, but I want to dispel one thing because for so long, why has this been happening? I donít think you have to be the tallest person on this stage to be president. I donít think you have to be the skinniest person. I donít think you have the loudest voice on the stage. I donít think that means that you will be the one that should be precedent. I think what matters is if youíre smart, if youíre competent and if you get things done."
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"I am the one that has passed over a hundred bills as the lead Democrat in that gridlock of Washington in Congress on this stage. I think youíve got to win and I am the one Mr. Vice president that has been able to win every red and purple congressional district as the lead on a ticket every time. I governed both with my head and my heart and if you think a woman canít beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day."
2019-11-20,Biden,"I think a womanís qualified to be president and thereís no reason why. If you think the woman is the most qualified person now you should vote for them. The reason why I think I should be president and be the nominee is number one, I have brought people together my entire career. In the United States Senate, Iíve passed more major legislation than everybody on this stage combined. From the violence against women act, to making sure we have the chemical weapons treaty to did to dealing with Milosevic."
2019-11-20,Biden,"The whole range of things that Iíve been engaged in my whole career. Iíve done it. Iíve brought people together. Iím always told by everybody on here, things have changed. You canít do that anymore. If we canít. I thought the question was initially ask of the Senator, how do you unify this country? We have to unify this country. I have done it. I have done it repeatedly and lastly to be commander in chief, thereís no time for on the job training. Iíve spent more time in the situation room, more time abroad, more time than anybody up here. I know every major world leader, they know me and they know when I speak. If Iím the president United States who were four who were against and what weíll do and weíll keep our word."
2019-11-20,Booker,"So look, this president has broken norms as youíve said. He used this platform to demean, degrade and divide this country in ways that are repugnant and appalling. But the next president, whoever they are, is going to have to be someone who can heal and bring this nation together, this whole nation. So absolutely in that office, I will do whatever it takes to make sure we bring this country together. But itís not for a kumbaya moment. We are a nation that achieves great things when we stand together and work together and fight together."
2019-11-20,Booker,"So absolutely. When I was mayor of the largest city in my state, and this is where I agree with mayor Pete. Mayoral experience is very important. And I happened to be the other road scholar mayor on this stage. And what I learned there is that you have to be an executive that can heal. In my city, we have racial divides. We have geographic divides that go from wealth to people that are struggling. The success of my city was because we brought us all together and did things that other people said couldnít be done. When I am president United States, my campaign from the very beginning has not changed. My charge is to see a nation right now, which has so much common pain to channel that back into a sense of common purpose and I will do whatever it takes. Bringing creativity to that office like has never been seen before."
2019-11-20,Sanders,"Well, I think the people of this country are catching on to the degree that this president thinks he is above the law. And what the American people are saying, ìNobody is above the lawî and I think what the American people are also saying is in fact, that if this president did break the law, he should be prosecuted like any other individual who breaks the law. But at the end of the day, what we need to do is to bring our people together, not just in opposition to Trump. The initial question I think that you wrote, that somebody raised him was that we are a divided nation. You know what? I kind of reject that. I think when you talk about the pain of working families in this country, majority of the American people want to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. When you talk about the climate crisis, the overwhelming majority of the American people know that it is real. They know we have to take on the fossil fuel industry."
2019-11-20,Sanders,"They know we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Even on issues like guns, the American people are coming together to end the horrific level of gun violence. So I believe, yep, weíve got to deal with Trump, but we also have to have an agenda that brings our people together so that the wealth and income doesnít just go to the people on top, but to all us."
2019-11-20,Biden,"Look, I would not direct my justice department like this president does. Iíd let them make their independent judgment. I would not dictate who should be prosecuted or who should be exonerated. Thatís not the role of the president of the United States. Itís the attorney general of the United States, not the presidentís attorney private attorney. And so I would whatever was determined by the attorney general, I supported, that I appointed, let them make an independent judgment. If that was the judgment that he violated the law and he should be in fact criminally prosecuted then so be it."
2019-11-20,Biden,"But I would not direct it and I donít think itís a good idea that we model ourselves after Trump and say, ìlock him up.î Look, we have to bring this country together. Letís start talking civilly to people and tweeting. The next president starts tweeting shouldÖ Anyway, it just, we look, itís about civility. We have to restore the soul of this country and thatís not who we are. Thatís not who weíve been. Thatís not who we should be."
2019-11-20,Biden,"Follow the law. Let the justice department make the judgment as to whether or not someone should be prosecuted, period."
2019-11-20,Sanders,"Well, I think Joe is right. I think that is the function of the attorney general, but what I am of the opinion is that the American people now do believe, and the more they see these impeachment hearings on television, they do believe that we have a president who thinks heís above the law. We have a president who is engaged in corruption. We have a president who was obstructed justice, and in my view, somebody was a violated the emoluments clause. I think Joe is right. That is the function of an independent department of justice, but my inclination is that the American people do believe that this president is in violation of the law."
2019-11-20,Biden,Can I respond very quickly?
2019-11-20,Biden,"Distinction, should he be impeached and should it be thrown out of office? Thatís one question. Heís very close to impeachingÖ Heís indicted himself. Number two, after heís thrown out of office or after heís defeated, should he be then prosecuted? Should he be prosecuted for a criminal offense while he was president? Thatís a judgment to be made by an attorney general."
2019-11-20,Yang,"There are only two countries in the world that donít have paid family leave for new moms, the United States of America and Papua New Guinea, that is the entire list and we need to get off this list as soon as possible. I would pass paid family leave is one of the first things we do. I have two kids myself who are four and seven, one of whom is autistic and has special needs and itís breaking families backs."
2019-11-20,Yang,"We need to start supporting our kids and families from the beginning because by the time theyíre showing up to Pre-K and kindergarten, in many cases, theyíre already years behind. Studies have shown that two thirds of our kidsí educational outcomes are determined by whatís happening to them at home. This is stress levels, number of words, read to them as children type of neighborhood, whether a parent has time to spend with them."
2019-11-20,Yang,"So we need to have a freedom dividend in place from day one, $1,000 a month for every American adult, which would put in many cases, $2,000 a month into families pockets so that they can either pay for childcare or if they want stay home with the child. We should not be pushing everyone to leave the home and go to the workforce. Many parents see that trade off and say if they leave the home and work, theyíre going to be spending all the money on childcare anyway. In many cases, itíd be better if the parents stays home with the child."
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"I looked at this economically and I want to make sure of that. We help people because itís just pointed out we are way behind the curve, our country is when it to providing paid family leave and childcare. We must do this and we will do this if we have the right person heading up the ticket so we can win big. But what I had done with all of my plans is I have showed how Iím going to pay for them meticulously."
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"I think that is really, really important when we have a president in the white house right now who have told over 10,000 lies. So when you look at my website at amyklobuchar.com you will see my plans and youíre also going to see how Iím going to pay for it. And I think that is so important because this president is literally increasing the debt, treating our farmers and workers like poker chips in a bankrupt casino and really putting this country in a worse financial situation every single day. So yes, my plan is three months. I think thatís good. Iíd love to do more."
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"As Iíve said before, Iíd love to staple free diplomas under peopleís chairs. I just am not going to go for things, and this is not, Iím not talking about Senator Harrisís plan here. But Iím talking about some of the other ideas that have been out here. I am not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car."
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"I think that we have an obligation, we have an obligation as a party to be yes, fiscally responsible. Yes, think big, but make sure we have peopleís backs and are honest with them about what we can pay for and that is everything from sending rich kids to college for free, which I donít support to kicking 149 million off their health insurance for health insurance in four years. I just think we have to be smart about how we do this."
2019-11-20,Harris,"Sure. Everybody please visit my website, kamalaharris.org for the details on everything I talk about. Six months, so part of how I believe weíre going to win this election is it is going to be because we are focused on the future. We are focused on the challenges that are presented today and not trying to bring back yesterday to solve tomorrow."
2019-11-20,Harris,"So on paid family leave, it is no longer the case in America that people are having children in their 20s. People are having children in their 30s often in their 40s, which means that these families and parents are often raising young children and taking care of their parents. Which requires a lot of work from traveling back and forth to a hospital to daycare, to all of the activities that are required, much less the healthcare needs that are required."
2019-11-20,Harris,"And what we are seeing in America today is the burden principally falls on women to do that work. And many women are having to make a very difficult choice whether theyíre going to leave a profession for which they have a passion to care for their family, or whether they are going to give up a paycheck that is part of what that family relies on. So six months paid family leave is meant to and is designed to adjust to the reality of womenís lives today."
2019-11-20,Harris,"The reality also is that women are not paid equal for equal work in America. We pass the Equal Pay Act in 1963 but fast forward to the year of our Lord 2019 and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar. Black women, 61 cents, Native American women, 58 cents Latinos, 53 cents."
2019-11-20,Harris,"So, but so my policy is about, thereís a whole collection of work that Iím doing that is focused on women and working women in America and the inequities and therefore the injustice that women in America are facing that needs to be resolved and addressed."
2019-11-20,Steyer,"When you look at inequality in the United States of America, you have to start with housing. Where you put your head at night determines so many things about your life. It determines where your kids go to school. It determines the air you breathe, where you shop, how long it takes you to get to work. What weíve seen in California is as a result of policy, we have millions too few housing units and that affects everybody in California."
2019-11-20,Steyer,"It starts with a homeless crisis that goes all through the state, but it also includes skyrocketing rents that affect every single working person in the state of California. I understand exactly what needs to be done here, which is we need to change policy and we need to apply resources here to make sure that we build literally millions of new units."
2019-11-20,Steyer,"But the other thing thatís going to be true about building these units is weíre going to have to build them in a way thatís sustainable. That in fact, how we build units where people live has a dramatic impact on climate and on sustainability."
2019-11-20,Steyer,"So we are going to have to direct dollars, weíre going to have to change policy and make sure that the localities and municipalities whoíve worked very hard to make sure that there are no new housing units built in their towns, that they have to change that and weíre going to have to force it and then weíre going to have to direct federal dollars to make sure that those units are affordable so that working people can live in places and not be spending 50% of their income on rent."
2019-11-20,Warren,"Yes. Think of it this way. Our housing problem in America is a problem on the supply side and that means that the federal government stopped building new housing a long time, affordable housing. Also private developers, theyíve gone up to the mansions. Theyíre not building the little two bedroom, one bath house that I grew up in, garage converted to be a bedroom for my three brothers. So Iíve got a plan."
2019-11-20,Warren,"For 3.2 million new housing units in America, those are housing units for working families for the working poor, for the poor poor for seniors who want to age in place for people with disabilities. For people who are coming back from being incarcerated. Itís about tenants rights, but thereís one more piece."
2019-11-20,Warren,"Housing is how we build wealth in America. The federal government has subsidized the purchase of housing for decades for white people and has said for black people, ìYouíre cut out of the deal.î That was known as red lining when I built a housing plan. Itís not only a housing plan about building new units, itís a housing plan about addressing what is wrong about government sponsored discrimination, how we need to address it and we need to say weíre going to reverse it."
2019-11-20,Booker,"Iím so grateful again as a mayor, who was a mayor during the recession, who was a mayor during a housing crisis who started my career as a tenantsí rights lawyer. This are all good points, but weíre not talking about something that is going on all over America, which is gentrification and low income families being moved further and further out, often compounding racial segregation. And so all of these things, we need to put more federal dollars in it, but weíve got to start empowering people."
2019-11-20,Booker,"We use our tax code to move wealth up the mortgage interest deduction. My plan is very simple. If youíre a renter who pays more than a third of your income in rent, then you will get a refundable tax credit between the amount youíre paying in the area meeting your rent. That empowers people in the same way we empower homeowners and what that does is it actually slashes poverty. 10 million people out, and by the way, for those people who are facing eviction, it is about time that the only people when they show up in rentals court that have a lawyer is not the landlord. It is also low income families struggling to stay in their home."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"We shouldnít have to pay farmers to take the edge off of a trade war that shouldnít have been started in the first place. I will support farmers, but not long ago I was in Boone, Iowa, a guy came up to me, he said, ìI got my Trump bailout check, but I would have rather spent that money on conservation.î By the way, this isnít even making farmers whole. If youíre in soybeans, for example, youíre getting killed and itís not just what this presidentís done with the trade war and a lot of parts of the country."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"The worst thing is these so-called small refinery waivers, which are killing those who were involved in ethanol. Look, I donít think this president cares one bit about farmers. He keeps asking them to take one for the team, but more and more Iím talking to people in rural America who see that theyíre not going to benefit from business as usual under this president."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"I believe that so many of the solutions lie with American farmers, but we have to stand up for them not just with direct subsidies and support, but with making sure we do something about the consolidation, the monopolies that leave farmers with fewer places to purchase supplies from and fewer places to sell their product to, and American farming should be one of the key pillars of how we combat climate change."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,I believe that the quest for the carbon negative farm could be as big as symbol of dealing with climate change as the electric car in this country. And itís an important part of how we make sure that we get a message out around dealing with climate change that recruits everybody to be part of the solution including conservative communities where a lot of people have been made to feel that admitting climate science would mean acknowledging their part of the problem.
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"Yes, but we wonít need them cause weíre going to fix the trade war."
2019-11-20,Gabbard,"This is an issue that impacts all of us as Americans and people all over the world. This is not a Democrat issue or Republican issue. This is about the environmental threats that each and every one of us face. These are the kinds of conversations that weíre having in our town hall meetings and house parties in different parts of the country where we have Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, and independents coming together saying, ìHey, we are all concerned about making sure that we have clean water to drink for our families, that we have clean air to breathe, that weíre able to raise our kids in a community thatís safe.î"
2019-11-20,Gabbard,"It is the hyper partisanship in Washington unfortunately, that has created this gridlock that has stood in the way of the kinds of progress that I bring bring about as president, transitioning our country off of fossil fuels and ending the nearly $30 billion in subsidies that we as taxpayers are currently giving to the fossil fuel industry. Instead of investing in a green, renewable energy economy. That leads us into the 21st century with good paying jobs, a sustainable economy, investing in infrastructure and transitioning our agriculture."
2019-11-20,Gabbard,"That is a great contributor to the environmental threats we face towards an agriculture system that focuses on local and regional production of food, healthy food that will actually feed the health and wellbeing of our people leading as a leader in the world to make the global change necessary to address these threats."
2019-11-20,Steyer,"Rachel, Iím the only person on this stage who will say that climate is the number one priority for me. Vice president Biden wonít say it. Senator Warren wonít say it. Itís a state of emergency and I would declare a state of emergency on day one. I would use the emergency powers of the presidency. I know that we have to do this. Iíve spent a decade fighting and beating oil companies, stopping pipelines, stopping fossil fuel plants, ensuring clean energy across the country. I know that we have to do this. I also know that we can do this. I would make this the number one priority of my foreign policy as well."
2019-11-20,Steyer,"We can do this and create literally millions of good paying union jobs across this country. I would make sure that my climate policy was led by environmental justice and members of the communities where this society has chosen to put our air and water pollution, which are low income black and brown communities and when we ask how are we going to pull this country together, how about this? We take on the biggest challenge in history. We save the world and we do it together. If you think that would pull America together, I do."
2019-11-20,Biden,"Yeah, I was. I think it is the existential threat to humanity. Itís the number one issue and I might add, I donít really need kind of a lecture from my friend. While I was passing the first climate change bill and that Politifact said was a game changer."
2019-11-20,Biden,"While I manage the $90 billion recovery plan, investing more money in infrastructure that related to clean energy than any time weíve ever done it. My friend was producing more coal mines and produce more coal around the world according to the press than all of Great Britain produces. I welcome him back into the fold here and heís been there for a long while. But the idea that we talk about where we started and how we are, letís get this straight. I think it is the existential threat of our time."
2019-11-20,Steyer,"Can I respond to that, Rachel?"
2019-11-20,Steyer,"I came to the conclusion over 10 years ago that climate was the absolute problem of our society and was the unintended consequence of our whole country being based on fossil fuels. Everybody in this room has lived in an economy based on fossil fuels and we all have to come to the same conclusion that I came to over a decade ago. If weíre waiting for Congress to pass one of the bills, and I know everybody on this stage cares about this, but Congress has never passed an important climate bill ever."
2019-11-20,Steyer,"This is a problem, which continues to get worse. Thatís why Iím saying itís a state of emergency. Thatís why Iím saying itís priority one. If it isnít priority one, itís not going to get done, and this is something where we absolutely have to address it upfront. We have to make it the most important thing and we can use it to rebuild and re-imagine what the United States is. We can be the moral leaders of the world again, while we clean up our air and water, and create millions of good paying jobs."
2019-11-20,Sanders,"Tom, you stated, you were talked about the need to make climate change a national emergency. Iíve introduced legislation to just do that. Now, I disagree with the thrust of the original question. Because your question has said, ìWhat are we going to do in decades?î We donít have decades. What the scientists are telling us, we donít get our act together within the next eight or nine years. Weíre talking about cities all over the world, major cities going on the water. Weíre talking about increased drought, talking about increased extreme weather disturbances."
2019-11-20,Sanders,"The United Nations is telling us that in the years to come, theyíre going to be hundreds of millions of climate refugees causing national security issues all over the world. What we have got to do tonight and I will do as president, is to tell the fossil fuel industry that theyíre short-term profits on not more important than the future of this planet. And by the way, the fossil fuel industry is probably criminally liable because they have lied and lied and lied when they had the evidence that they are carbon products were destroying the planet and maybe we should think about prosecuting them as well."
2019-11-20,Harris,"With all due deference to the fact that this is a presidential debate, Donald Trump got punked. He has conducted foreign policy since day one, born out of a very fragile ego that fails to understand that one of the most important responsibilities of the commander in chief is to concern herself with the security of our nation and Homeland. And to do it in a way that understands that part of the strength of who we are as a nation and therefore an extension of our ability to be secure is not only that we have a vibrant military, but that when we walk in any room around the globe, we are respected because we keep to our word, we are consistent, we speak truth, and we are loyal."
2019-11-20,Harris,"What Donald Trump has done from pulling out of the Paris agreement to pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal to consistently turning a back on people who have stood with us in difficult times, including most recently, the Kurds, points out that Donald Trump is the greatest threat to the national security of our nation at this moment."
2019-11-20,Harris,"Not at this point. There are no concessions to be made. He has traded a photo op for nothing. He has abandoned by shutting down the operations with South Korea for the last year and a half, so those operations which should be, and those exercises which should be active because they are in our best national security."
2019-11-20,Harris,The relationship that we have with Japan. He has in every way compromised our ability to have any influence on slowing down or at least having a check and balance on North Koreaís nuclear program.
2019-11-20,Biden,"First of all, I would go back and making sure we had the alliances we had before he became president. He has absolutely ostracized us from South Korea. He has given North Korea everything they want to create in the legitimacy. By having a meeting with Kim Jong-un whoís a thug, although he points out that Iím a rabid dog needed to be beaten with a stick. Very recently it was a comment."
2019-11-20,Sanders,"Other than that, you like him."
2019-11-20,Biden,"Other than that, I like him. And not in Japan and Australia and being a Pacific power. And putting pressure on China in order for them to make sure that it is a non, it is a nuclear-free peninsula. And the way we do that is we make clear to China, which I have done personally with the president of China, and that is weíre going to move up our defenses. We are going to continue to make sure we increase our relationship with South Korea. And if they view that as a threat, itís an easy thing to respond to. They in fact can in fact put pressure on."
2019-11-20,Biden,"Ö to respond to. They can, in fact, put pressure on North Korea. But the fact is that weíre in a position where he has done this across the world. Heís embraced thugs. Look what Putin is doing in Europe. Putin is, his whole effort is to break up NATO to increase his power, look what heís done to it. This guy has no idea what heís doing, he has no notion how to go about it and we need a commander in chief for what he stands. Everybody knows what he or she-"
2019-11-20,Sanders,"Well, let me just say this. One of the big differences between the Vice President and myself is he supported the terrible war in Iraq and I helped lead the opposition against it. And not only that, I voted against the very first Gulf War as well. And I think we need a foreign policy which understands who our enemies are, that we donít have to spend more money on the military than the next 10 nations combined. But to answer your question, yeah. I think it is time after spending many trillions of dollars on these endless wars which have resulted in more dislocation and mass migrations and pain in that region, it is time to bring our troops home."
2019-11-20,Sanders,"But unlike Trump, I will not do it through a tweet at three oíclock in the morning. I will do it working with the international community and if itís necessary to negotiate with the Taliban, of course, we will do that. But at the end of the day we have to rethink the entire war on terror, which has caused so much pain and lost so many lives, not only for our own men and women in the armed forces, but for people in that region as well."
2019-11-20,Yang,"Well, first Iíd say, ìIím sorry I beat your guy.î"
2019-11-20,Warren,"Itís a sorry, youíre not sorry?"
2019-11-20,Yang,"Well, not sorry. And second, I would say the days of meddling in American elections are over and we will take any undermining of our democratic processes as an act of hostility and aggression. The American people would back me on this. We know that theyíve found an underbelly and theyíve been clawing at it and itís made so that we canít even trust our own democracy. The third thing I would say is that weíre going to live up to our international commitments. Weíre going to recommit to our partnerships and alliances including NATO. And it was James Mattis, that said that the more you invest in diplomats and diplomacy, the less you have to spend on ammunition."
2019-11-20,Yang,"That has to be the path forward to help build an international consensus, not just against Russia, but also to build a coalition that will help us put pressure on China in terms of their treatment of their ethnic minorities and whatís going on in Hong Kong. I want to propose a new world data organization, like a WTO for data because right now unfortunately weíre living in a world where data is the new oil and we donít have our arms around it. These are the ways that weíll actually get Russia to the table and make it so they have to join the international community and stop resisting appeals to the world order."
2019-11-20,Booker,"Well, first of all, this is a president who seems to want to go up against China in a trade war by pulling away from our allies and in fact, attacking them as well. We use a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada. At the very time that China is breaking international rules, is practicing unfair practices, stealing technology, forcing technology transfer and violating human rights, this nation is pulling away from critical allies. We would need to show strength against China. Thereís a larger battle going on on the planet earth right now between totalitarian and dictatorial countries and free democracies, and we see the scorecard under this president not looking so good, with China actually shifting more towards an authoritarian government with its leader now getting rid of term limits."
2019-11-20,Booker,"I believe we need a much stronger policy. One thatís not led as president Trump seems to want to do in a transactional way, but one thatís led by American values. Yes, we will call China out for human rights violations, but not only that, we will stop engaging in things that violate American rights. Because it is a human rights violation when people at our border, children are thrown in cages. Itís a human rights violations without coming to the United States Congress for an authorization to the use of military force for us to refuel Saudi jets to bomb Yemeni children. It is about time that this country is led by someone who will say the values of freedom and democracy or what we are going to lead with, and begin to check China, check Putin and the other folks who are trying to undermine American values and democratic values around the globe."
2019-11-20,Biden,"Yes. And I said it at the time, Khashoggi was in fact murdered and dismembered and I believe in the order of the Crown Prince. And I would make it very clear we were not going to in fact sell more weapons to them, we were going to in fact make them pay the price and make them in fact the pariah that they are. Thereís very little social redeeming value in the present government in Saudi Arabia. And I would also, as pointed out, I would end subsidies that we have, end the sale of material to the Saudis. Well, theyíre going in and murdering children and theyíre murdering innocent people and so they have to be held accountable."
2019-11-20,Biden,"And with regard to China, we should, look, unless we make it clear that we stand for human rights, we should be going to the United Nations seeking condemnation of China. What theyíre doing with a million Uighurs that are essentially in concentration camps in the west. We should be vocally speaking out about the violation of the commitment they made to Hong Kong. We have to speak out and speak loudly about violations of human rights."
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,Yes.
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"We need a new foreign policy in this country and that means renewing our relationships with our allies. It means rejoining international agreement and it means reasserting our American values. When the President did not stand up the way he should have to that killing and that dismemberment of a journalist with an American newspaper, that sent a signal to all dictators across the world that that was okay, and thatís wrong."
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"And I want to add a few things to what my colleagues have said. First of all, the question about Russia. When we look at international agreements, we must start negotiating back with Russia, which has been a horrible player on the international scene. But the President precipitously got out of the nuclear agreement with Russia and we must start negotiating even though they were cheating for the good of this world. And we must also start the negotiations for the New START Treaty. And when it comes to China, we need someone that sees the long-term like I do, just like the Chinese do. Because we have a president that literally makes decisions based on his next tweet and they are in it for the long game."
2019-11-20,Sanders,"I think I may have been the first person up here to make it clear that Saudi Arabia not only murdered Khashoggi, but this is a brutal dictatorship which gets every taken can to crush democracy, treats women as third class citizens. And when we rethink our American foreign policy, what we have got to know is that Saudi Arabia is not a reliable ally. We have got to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia together in a room under American leadership and say, ìWe are sick and tired of us spending huge amounts of money and human resources because of your conflicts.î"
2019-11-20,Sanders,"And by the way, the same thing goes with Israel and the Palestinians. It is no longer good enough for us to simply to be pro-Israel. I am pro-Israel, but we must treat the Palestinian people as well with the respect and dignity that they deserve. What is going on in Gaza right now, where youth unemployment is 70 or 80% is unsustainable. We need to be rethinking who our allies are around the world, work with United nations and not continue to support brutal dictatorships."
2019-11-20,Warren,"Yes, I think it should be. All three of my brothers served in the military. One was career military, the other two also served. I think itís an important part of who we are as Americans and I think the notion of shared service is important. Itís how we help bring our nation together, itís how people learn to work together from different regions, people who grew up differently. Itís also about how families share that sacrifice. I remember what it was like when I was a little girl, my brother, my oldest brother who served five and a half years off and on in combat in Vietnam. And what it was like for my mother every day to check the mailbox, had we heard from Don Reed, howís he doing?"
2019-11-20,Warren,"And if there was a letter, she was brighter than the day. And if it wasnít, sheíd say, ìWell, maybe tomorrow.î This is about building for our entire nation and I believe we should do that. I also believe we should have other service opportunities in this country. For example, what I want to do is for our federal lands, I want to bring in 10,000 people who want to be able to serve in our federal lands to be able to help rebuild our national forests and national parks as a way to express both their public service and their commitment to fighting back against climate change-"
2019-11-20,Warren,We can do this as a nation.
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"We need to re-prioritize our budget as a whole and our military spending in particular. Itís not just how much, although we certainly need to look at the runaway in military spending, itís also where. Right now we are spending a fraction of the intention and resources on things like the artificial intelligence research that China is doing right now. If we fall behind on artificial intelligence, the most expensive ships that the United States is building just turn into bigger targets. We do not have a 21st century security strategy coming from this president. After all, heís relying on 17th century security technologies like a moat full of alligators or a big wall. There is no concept of strategic planning for how civilian diplomatic and military security work needs to take place for the future."
2019-11-20,Booker,Can I respond to Buttigieg?
2019-11-20,Warren,Can I respond on this?
2019-11-20,Gabbard,"Yes, I would. We have seen for far too long the kind of racial bigotry, divisiveness and attacks that have unfortunately taken the lives of our fellow Americans. Leadership starts at the top. Itís important that we set the record straight and correct the racial injustices that exist in a very institutional way in our country. Beginning with things that have to do with our criminal justice system, where predominantly the failed war on drugs that has been continuing to be waged in this country has disproportionately impacted people of color and people in poverty. This is something that Iíll do as president and Commander-in-Chief, is to overhaul our criminal justice system working in a bipartisan way to do things like end the failed war on drugs and the money bail system."
2019-11-20,Gabbard,"And thatís the kinds of prison reforms and sentencing reforms that we need to see that will correct the failures of the past. The most important thing here is that we recognize that we have to treat each other with respect, all of us as fellow Americans regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, gender orientation, and our politics. That kind of leadership starts at the top. As president, I will usher in a 21st century White House that actually represents the interests of all Americans, first and foremost."
2019-11-20,Yang,"Well, first we have to designate white supremacist terrorism as domestic terrorism so that the Department of Justice can properly measure it. I talked to an anti- hate activist named Christian Picciolini, who told me about how he was radicalized over a 10 year period. He said he was a lonely 14-year-old and that he was reached out to by a hate group and he wound up joining it for a decade. Now, heís out and heís helping convert people out of those hate groups and back into the rest of society. But what he told me was that if anyone had reached out to him when he was that hurt, broken 14-year-old boy, he would have gone with them."
2019-11-20,Yang,"He said, ìIf it had been a coach I would have gone with him. If it had been a mentor teacher, I would have gone with them, but instead it was a hate group.î What we have to do is we have to get into the roots of our communities and create paths forward for men in particular, who right now are falling through the cracks. And when you look at gun violence in this country, 96 plus percent of the shooters weíre talking about are young boys and young men. We have to as a country start finding ways to turn our boys into healthy, strong, young men who do not hate, but instead feel like they have paths forward in todayís economy."
2019-11-20,Biden,"Yes. And by the way, itís one of the reasons. The first thing I would do is make sure we pass the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization, which I wrote. The fact, I didnít write the reauthorization, I wrote the original act. The fact is that what happens now is that we in fact, have to fundamentally change the culture, the culture of how women are treated. Thatís why as Vice President, when I asked the President if I could start the movement on the college campuses to say, ìItís on us.î Itís everyoneís responsibility."
2019-11-20,Biden,"We do not spend nearly enough time dealing withÖ I was stunned when I did a virtual town meeting that told me 30,000 people were on the call, young people between 15 and 25. And found out, ìI said, what do you need to make you safer on college campuses and your schools?î You know what they said? ìGet men involved, engage the rest of the community.î And thatís why we started this movement on the college campus is to fundamentally change the culture."
2019-11-20,Biden,"No man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs. We have to just change the culture, period, and keep punching at it and punching at it and punching it. It will be a big punchÖ no, I really mean it. Itís a gigantic issue and we have to make it clear from the top, from the President on down that we will not tolerate it. We will not tolerate this culture."
2019-11-20,Harris,"Well, I donít know, that was a question that related to a stock photograph that his campaign published. But listen, I think that it really speaks to a larger issue and Iíll speak to the larger issue. I believe that the Mayor has made apologies for that. The larger issue is that for too long, I think candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic Party and have overlooked those constituencies. They show up when itís close to election time and show up in a black church and want to get the vote, but just havenít been there before."
2019-11-20,Harris,"I mean, there are plenty of people who applauded black women and for the success of the 2018 election, applauded black women for the election of a Senator from Alabama. But at some point folks get tired of just saying, ìOh, thank me for showing up,î and say, ìWell, show up for me.î Because when black women are three to four times more likely to die in connection with childbirth in America. When the sons of black women will die because of gun violence more than any other cause of death. When black women make 61 cents on the dollar as compared to all women who tragically make 80 cents on the dollar, the question has to be where you been and what are you going to do? And do you understand who the people are?"
2019-11-20,Harris,"And Iím running for president because I believe that we have to have leadership in this country who has worked with and have the experience of working with all folks, and weíve got to recreate the Obama coalition to win. And that means about women, thatís people of color, thatís our LGBTQ community, thatís working people, thatís our labor unions. But that is how we are going to win this election. And I intend to win."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"My response is I completely agree. And I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who donít yet know me. And before I share whatís in my plans, let me talk about whatís in my heart and why this is so important. As mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low income, for eight years I have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built up over centuries, but then compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory. I care about this because my faith teaches me that salvation has to do with how I make myself useful to those who have been excluded, marginalized and cast aside and oppressed in society."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"And I care about this because while I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country. Turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate. And seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me working side by side, shoulder to shoulder. Making it possible for me to be standing here wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldnít have happened two elections ago, lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day even if they are nothing like me in their experience."
2019-11-20,Harris,"Look, there is a lot at stake in this election. And Iíve said it many times I think justice is on the ballot in 2020. And itís about economic justice, itís about justice for children, itís about justice for our teachers. I could go on down the list. The issue really is not what is the fight, the issue has to be how are we going to win. And to win we have to build a coalition and rebuild the Obama coalition. I keep referring to that because thatís the last time we won."
2019-11-20,Harris,"And the way that that election looked and what that coalition looked like was it was about having a leader who had worked in many communities, knows those communities and has the ability to bring people together and everyone is going to have to be judged on their experience and therefore ability to bring folks together around our commonalities of which I believe there are many."
2019-11-20,Warren,"I think it is really important that we actually talk about what weíre willing to get in the fight for. And I just want to give one example around this. Senator Harris, rightly raised the question of economic justice. Let me give a specific example, and that is student loan debt. Right now African Americans are more likely to borrow money to go to college, borrow more money while theyíre in college and have a harder time paying that debt off after they get out. Today in America, a new study came out 20 years out. Whites borrowed money, 94% of them have paid off their student loan debt. 5% of African Americans had paid it off. I believe that means everyone on the stage should be embracing student loan debt forgiveness. It will help close the black-white wealth gap. Letís do something tangible and real to make change in this country."
2019-11-20,Warren,"If there are parts of the wall that are not useful in our defense, of course, we should do it. The real point here is that we need to stop this man-made crisis at the border. Trump is the one who has created this crisis and he has done it in no small part by helping destabilize the governments even further in Central America. He has withdrawn aid, that means that families have to flee for their lives, have to flee for any economic opportunity. You know what? I found out that our government was actually taking away children from their families."
2019-11-20,Warren,"I went down to the border, I went down there and immediately. I was in McAllen, Texas, and I just hope everyone remembers what this looks like. There was like a giant Amazon warehouse filled with cages of women, cages of men and cages of little girls and little boys. I spoke to a woman who was in the cage of nursing mothers and she told me sheíd given a drink to a police officer, and that the word had come down from the gangs that she was helping the police. She knew what that meant. She wrapped up her baby and she ran for the border. We need to treat the people who come here with dignity and with respect. A great nation does not separate children from their families. We need to live our values at the border every single day."
2019-11-20,Booker,"Look, I want to be quick on this because Iíd like to get back to something that I wasnít included in, isÖ"
2019-11-20,Warren,So would we all.
2019-11-20,Booker,"Absolutely, if this is not effective, we see people cutting holes in this wall, his wall, the way he brags about it, itís just wrong. We need to have policies that respect dignity, keep us safe and strong. I wanted to return back to this issue of black voters. I have a lifetime of experience with black voters, Iíve been one since I was 18. Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African American voters. Black voters are pissed off and theyíre worried. Theyíre pissed off because the only time our issues seem to be really paid attention to by politicians is when people are looking for their vote."
2019-11-20,Booker,"And theyíre worried because the Democratic Party, we donít want to see people miss this opportunity and lose because we are nominating someone that isnít trusted, doesnít have authentic connection. Thatís whatís on the ballot and issues do matter. I have a lot of respect for the Vice President. He has sworn me into my office as a hero. This week I hear him literally say that I donít think we should legalize marijuana. I thought you mightíve been high when you said it."
2019-11-20,Booker,"And let me tell you, because marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people. And itís what the war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people. And let me say this, thereís more African Americans under criminal supervision in America than all the slaves since 1850, do not roll up into communities and not talk directly to issues that are going to relate to the liberation of children."
2019-11-20,Booker,"Because there are people in Congress right now that admit to smoking marijuana, while there are people, our kids are in jail right now for those drug crimes. These are the kind of issues that mean a lot to our community and if we donít have somebody authenticallyÖ we lost the last election. Let me just give you this data example-"
2019-11-20,Booker,"We lost in Wisconsin because of a massive dimunition, a lot of reasons, but there was a massive dimunition in the African American vote. We need to have someone that can inspire, as Kamala said, to inspire African Americans to the polls in record numbers."
2019-11-20,Biden,"Iíll be very brief. Number one, I think we should decriminalize marijuana, period. And I think anyone who has a record should be let out of jail, their records expunged and be completely zeroed out. But I do think it makes sense based on data that we should study what the long-term effects for the use of marijuana, thatís all it is. Number one, everybody gets out, record expunged."
2019-11-20,Biden,"Secondly, Iím part of that Obama coalition. I come out of the black community in terms of my support. If you notice I have more people supporting me in the black community that have announced from me because they know me. They know who I am. Three former chairs of the Black Caucus, the only black African American woman that ever been elected to the United States Senate, a whole range of people. My point is-"
2019-11-20,Harris,Thatís not true.
2019-11-20,Booker,"Thatís not true, not true."
2019-11-20,Biden,"I said the first African American woman. My point is one of the reasons I was picked to be vice president was because of my relationship, longstanding relationship with the black community. I was part of that coalition."
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"Well, of course. We should codify Roe V Wade into law. That is what we should do. This President indicated early on what he was going to do and heís done it. When he was running for office, he literally said, ìWomen should go to jail.î Then he dialed it back and said, ìDoctors should go to jail.í No surprise that weíre seeing these kinds of laws in Georgia, and Alabama, where his allies are passing these bills. What we have to remember is that the people are with us. I predict this will be a big election in issue in the general election. I just canít wait to stand across from Donald Trump and say this to him, ìYou know what? The people are with us. Over 70% of the people support Roe V Wade, over 90% of the people support funding for Planned Parenthood and making sure that women can get the healthcare they need.î He is off the track on this and he will hear from the women of America. This is how weíre going to win this election."
2019-11-20,Warren,"Look, I believe that abortion rights are human rights. I believe that they are also economic rights. Protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party. Understand this. When someone makes abortion illegal in America, rich women will still get abortions. Itís just going to fall hard on poor women. Itís going to fall hard on girls. Women who donít even know that theyíre pregnant because they have been molested by an uncle. I want to be an America where everybody has a chance. I know it can be a hard decision for people, but hereís the thing, when it comes down to that decision, a woman should be able to call on her mother. She should be able to call on her partner. She should be able to call on her priest or her rabbi, but the one entity that should not be in the middle of that decision is the government."
2019-11-20,Warren,"I have made clear what I think the Democratic Party stands for. Iím not here to try to drive anyone out of this party. Iím not here to try to build fences, but I am here to say, ìThis is what I will fight for as President of the United States.î The women of America can count on me."
2019-11-20,Sanders,"[crosstalk 01:42:32] mentioned that women feel troubling on it. Well, let me just tell you that if thereís ever a time in American history where the men of this country must stand with the women, this is the moment. I get very tired, very tired of hearing the hypocrisy from conservatives who say, ìGet the government off our backs. We want small government.î Well, if you want to get the government out of the backs of the American people, then understand that it is women who control their own bodies, not politicians."
2019-11-20,Booker,This is a voting issue.
2019-11-20,Booker,"This is a voting issue. This is a voter suppression issue. Right here in this great state of Georgia, it was the voter suppression, particularly of African American communities, that prevented us from having a Governor Stacey Abrams, right now. That is, when you have undemocratic needs, when you suppress peopleís votes to get elected, those are the very people youíre going to come after when youíre in office. This bill opposed by over 70%. The Heartbeat Bill here opposed by over 70% of Georgians, is the result from voter suppression. This gets back to the issue about making sure we are fighting every single day, that whoever is the nominee, they can overcome the attempts to suppress the votes, particularly of low income and minority voters and particularly in the black community like we saw here in Georgia."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"Well, we need federal leadership to establish voting rights for the 21st century because this affects every other issue that we care about. Now, the House of Representatives passed a pro democracy anti-corruption bill, which is one of many good bills to die in Mitch McConnellís hands in the United States Senate. We know that with the White House in the right hands, we can make, for example, election days a federal holiday. We can use carrots and sticks to induce states to do the right thing with automatic voter registration, same day voter registration, making it easier for people to vote and in particular, recognizing that we cannot allow the kind of racially motivated or partisan voter suppression or gerrymandering that often dictates the outcome of election before the voting even begins."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,Right now we have politicians picking out their voters rather than the other way around. That compounding with what is being done to restrict the right to vote means that our democracy is not worthy of the name.
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"I just, I want to Ö This-"
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"While these process issues are not always fashionable, we must act to reform our democracy itself, including when it comes to choosing our presidency. What we do in [crosstalk 01:45:48] election, giving it to the person who got the most votes."
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,I want to point out.
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"Election, giving it to the person who got the most votes."
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"I agree with what the mayor has just said, but this is a good example where he has said the right words, but I actually have the experience and in leading 11 of the bills that are in that house passed bill you just referred to. I think this kind of experience matters. I have been devoted to this from the time that Iíve got to the Senate. I think having that experience, knowing how you can get things done, leading the bills to take the social media companies to task a bipartisan bill to say, ìYeah, you have to say where these ads come from and how theyíre paid for,î and stop the unbelievable practice where we still have 11 states that donít have backup paper ballots. That is my bipartisan bill and I am so close to getting it done. The way I get it done is if Iím president. Just like I have won statewide, and Mayor, I have all appreciation for your good work as a local official and you did not when you tried, I also have actually done this work. I think experience should matter."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"First of all, Washington experience is not the only experience that matters. Thereís more than a hundred years of Washington experience on this stage and where are we right now as a country? I have the experience of bringing people together to get something done. I have the experience of being commanded into a war zone by an American president. I have the experience of knowing what is at stake as the decisions made in those big white buildings come into our lives, our homes, our families, our workplaces and our marriages. I would submit that this is the kind of experience we need, not just to go to Washington, but to change it before it is too late."
2019-11-20,Gabbard,I need to jump in here. Thank you.
2019-11-20,Gabbard,"I mean, voting rights are essential for our democracy. Securing our elections is essential for our democracy. Iíve introduced legislation called the Securing Americaís Elections Act that mandates paper ballots to make sure that every single voterís voice is heard, but I want to get back to Pete Buttigieg and his comment about experience. Pete, youíll agree that the service that we both have provided to our country as veterans by itself does not qualify us to serve as commander in chief. I think the most recent example of your inexperience in national security and foreign policy came from your recent careless statement about how you as president be willing to send our troops to Mexico to fight the cartels."
2019-11-20,Gabbard,"As commander in chief, leader of our armed forces, I bring extensive experience serving for seven years in Congress on the Foreign Affairs Committee, on the Armed Services Committee, on the Homeland Security Committee, meeting with leaders of countries around the world, working with military commanders of different commands-"
2019-11-20,Gabbard,#NAME?
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"I know that itís par for the course in Washington to take remarks out of context, but that is outlandish even by the standards of todayís politics."
2019-11-20,Gabbard,Are you saying that you didnít say that?
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"I was talking about U.S., Mexico, cooperation. Weíve been doing security cooperation with Mexico for years with law enforcement cooperation and a military relationship that could continue to be developed with training relationships for example. Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico?"
2019-11-20,Gabbard,Thatís not what I said. Thatís not what I said. Thatís not what I said.
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"Iím talking about building up alliances. If your question is about experience, letís also talk about judgment. One of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was Bashar al-Assad. I have in my experience, such as it is, whether you think it counts or not, since it wasnít accumulated in Washington, enough judgment that I would not have sat down with a murderous dictator like that."
2019-11-20,Gabbard,"Thank you. You were asked directly whether you would send our troops to Mexico to fight cartels and your answer was, yes. The fact checkers can check this out, but your point about judgment is absolutely correct. Our commander in chief does need to have good judgment and what youíve just pointed out is that you would lack the courage to meet with both adversaries and friends to ensure the peace and national security of our nation. I take the example of those leaders who have come before us, leaders like JFK, who met with Khrushchev, like Roosevelt, who met with Stalin."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"Like Donald Trump, who met with Kim."
2019-11-20,Gabbard,"Like Reagan, who met and worked with Gorbachev. These issues of national security are incredibly important. I will meet with and do what is necessary to make sure that no more of our brothers and sisters in uniform are needlessly sent into harmís way fighting regime change wars that undermine our national security. Iíll bring real leadership and experience to the White House."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,[crosstalk 01:51:07] respond to this. This is a [crosstalk 01:51:09].
2019-11-20,Sanders,"[crosstalk 01:51:09] right to the point. The American people understand that the political system we have today is corrupt and it is not just voter suppression, which cost the Democratic Party a governorship here in this state, not just denying black people and people of color, the right to vote, but we also have a system through Citizens United, which allows a billionaires to buy elections. What we need to do, simple and straight forward, in every state in this country through the federal government, if you are 18 you have a right to vote, end of discussion. We have to overturn Citizens United. We need to move toward public funding of elections."
2019-11-20,Steyer,"Well, I agree with exactly what Bernie said, but I want to talk about how weíre going to win in 2020. I donít mean to change the subject, but I think itís sort of important that the Democratic Party not only beat Donald Trump in 2020, but have a sweeping victory across the country. What thatís going to mean is turnout. In the United States of America, the Democratic Party keeps talking about trying to persuade a few people who are Republicans to like us, when up to half the people donít vote at all because they think neither party tells the truth, no one deals with my issues, the system is broken, why would we vote, but what weíve found at NextGen America, is that is the start of a conversation about why votes are so important. If you look at 2018, and flipping the house, what really happened was Democratic voting went up by three quarters in the 38 congressional districts where NextGen America was turning out young people. The turnout went up by more than a hundred percent, more than double."
2019-11-20,Steyer,"For us to win, for everybody on this stage, for whoeverís the candidate to have a Senate thatís Democratic, for us to have the sweeping victory that we absolutely are going to have next year,-"
2019-11-20,Steyer,-itís a turnout question. Weíre going to have to tell the truth-

2019-11-20,Booker,"Thank you, Rachel. Itís an honor to be here tonight. I have not yet qualified for the December stage. I need your help to do that. If you believe in my voice and that I should be up here, please go to CoryBooker.com, please help. I had a closing statement prepared, but I saw in the audience during the break, a man named John Lewis. Perhaps itís interesting and important for me to mention why Iím so grateful to him. Iíve been calling in this whole election for our need to fight and fight the right way by bringing people together to create transformative change, not just beat Donald Trump. Thatís the floor. We need to go to the ceiling. We need to go to the mountaintop. I am literally here on this stage right now because 50 years ago, there was a lawyer on a couch who changed his life, changed his mind to get up and start representing families, one of them, mine, who are discriminated against. The house I grew up in is because of that lawyerís activity."
2019-11-20,Booker,"When I asked him why, why he did what he did, he told me that on March 7th, 1965, he was watching a movie called Judgment at Nuremberg on TV. They interrupted that movie to show a bridge in Alabama called the Edmund Pettus Bridge. There he saw John Lewis and other marchers who were beaten viciously by Alabama state troopers. We all owe a debt that we cannot repay. We all drink deeply from wells of freedom and liberty that we did not dig. This is the moment in America where we need a leader that can inspire us to get up and fight again, that we have truly a moral moment in America like it was back in 1965. If you give me a chance to lead, I will cause what John Lewis says is good trouble. I will challenge us. I will ask more from you than any other president has ever asked before,-"

2019-11-20,Steyer,"I started by saying that everybody here is more patriotic and more competent than the criminal in the White House. I stand by that statement, but Iím different from everybody else on this stage. I know that the government in Washington D.C., is broken. I know that itís been purchased by corporations and Iíve spent a decade putting together coalitions of ordinary American citizens to beat those corporations. Iím the only one on this stage whoís willing to talk about structural change in Washington itself, term limits, that if weíre going to make bold changes, weíre going to need new and different people in charge. Iím the only person on this stage whoís spent decades building an international business."
2019-11-20,Steyer,"Whoever of us is the Democratic nominee is going to have to face Mr. Trump or the Republican and talk about the economy, talk about growth, understand that we can make Mr. Trump what he is, a fraud and a failure on the economy, which is his strong point. Iím the only person on this stage who will say that climate is my first priority, that itís our biggest challenge, but itís our biggest opportunity to recreate this country. If you want to beat Mr. Trump, if you want to break the corporate stranglehold on this government, if you want to pass all of the progressive policies that everyone on this stage wants, Iím the person who can do it."
2019-11-20,Steyer,I have spent a decade trusting the American people.
2019-11-20,Steyer,Iím asking you to trust me.
2019-11-20,Gabbard,"My personal commitment to you, to all of my fellow Americans, is to treat you with respect and compassion, something that we in Hawaii call Aloha. Every single person deserves to be treated with respect, regardless of race, religion, or gender, or even your politics. Inclusion, unity, respect, Aloha, these will be the operating principles for my administration. Now, Dr. Martin Luther King visited Hawaii first back in 1959, where he expressed his appreciation for what we call the Aloha spirit. He said, ìWe look to you for inspiration as a bold example for what you have already succeeded in the areas of racial harmony and racial justice, where we are still struggling to achieve in other sections of the country.î He later went on to say, ìAs I looked out at the various faces in various colors mingled together like the waters of the sea, I see only one face, the face of the future.î Working side by side, letís defeat the divisiveness of Donald Trump. Come together and usher in a 21st century of racial harmony, of racial justice, peace inclusion, and true equality, working side by side. Letís make Dr. Kingís dream a reality."
2019-11-20,Yang,"Iím here with my wife Evelyn, tonight. We have two young boys, Christopher and Damian. How many of you all are parents like us here in the room? If youíre a parent, youíve had this thought. Maybe youíve been afraid to express it, and it is this, our kids are not all right. Theyíre not all right because weíre leaving them a future that is far darker than the lives that we have led as their parents. We are going through the greatest economic transformation in our countryís history, the fourth industrial revolution, and it is pushing more and more of our people to the side. We talk as if Donald Trump is a cause of all of our problems. He is not. He is a symptom and we need to cure the disease."
2019-11-20,Yang,"Now, my first move was not to run for president of the United States because I am not insane. My first move was to go to D.C., talk to our leaders and say, ìTechnology is ripping us apart. Immigrants are being scapegoated, our kids are being left behind and the American dream that my parents came here to find is dying before our eyes.î The people in Washington D.C. had nothing for this. They donít want to touch it. They donít want to talk about an issue they donít think they have a solution for. Iím not running for president because I fantasized about being president."
2019-11-20,Yang,"Iím running for president because like many of you here in this room tonight, Iím a parent and a patriot and I have seen the future that weíre leaving for our kids. It is not something Iím willing to accept. We need to create a new way forward for our people. If you want to join us in rewriting the rules of the 21st century economy, go to Yang2020.com, and make it so that we can look our kids in the eyes and say to them and believe it, ìYour country loves you, your country values you and you will be all right.î"
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"The nation was riveted this week by the testimony in Washington. One of the people we heard from yesterday was Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. What he said was this, he spoke to his immigrant father and he said, ìIn this country, you can tell the truth and itís going to be fine.î It reminded me of a army council years and years ago in the McCarthy hearing, someone from Iowa, actually, Mr. Welch, who said, ìHave you no sense of decency, sir?î I want us to remember that this election is, yes, an economic check on this President. I have bold ideas that we can do to go forward as a country to make college more affordable and bring down the costs of healthcare, yes. This is also a patriotism check, a value check, a decency check. When you look at the people that turned out in Kentucky, and turned out in Virginia, people turned out that didnít vote in 2016. The African Americans are turning out like we didnít see before, but we also, and they must be with us and we must get our fired up Democratic base with us."
2019-11-20,Klobuchar,"We also, letís get those independents and moderate Republicans who cannot stomach this guy anymore. This is how we build the coalition. We donít just beat Donald Trump, we bring the U.S. Senate to some sense. We send Mitch McConnell packing. This is how we win. If you want to join us and remember that this wonít be for me, a personal victory, itíll be a national victory of someone that wins in red districts and suburban purple districts and bright blue districts every single time, if you want to join us and if you believe that our work doesnít end on election day, but begins on inauguration day, join us AmyKlobuchar.com. Thank you."
2019-11-20,Harris,"Weíre in a fight. This is a fight for our rule of law, for our democracy and for our system of justice, and itís a fight we need to win. To fight this fight, I believe we have to have the ability to not only have a nominee who can go toe to toe with Donald Trump. I have taken on Jeff [Session 00:23:44], I have taken on Bill Barr, I have taken on Brett Kavanaugh. I know I have the ability to do that. We also need someone who can unify the party and the country and who has the experience of having done that. Iíve done that work. I believe we need someone who has the ability to speak to all the people regardless of their race, their gender, their party affiliation, where they live geographically or the language their grandmother speaks."
2019-11-20,Harris,"My entire career has been spent having one client and one client only, the people. I have never represented a corporation. I have never represented a special interest. In this election, justice and the various injustices people are facing regardless of where they live or their race or gender, are very much on the ballot, from economic justice to reproductive justice, to health care justice, to educational justice. I truly believe that when we overcome these injustices, we will then unlock the potential of the American people and the promise of America. Thatís the America I believe in. Thatís the America I see. That is why Iím running for president."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"Well, first of all, I want to remark that weíre in the city of Atlanta, a city where a great local leader, Maynard Jackson, helped create the black middle class that Atlanta is known by, by ensuring that taxpayer dollars were spent in a way that reflected the need to expand opportunity to those who were excluded. Just as local leaders have shown great leadership, we need to use the powers of the presidency on challenges like this, expanding opportunity and expanding a sense of belonging to those who have been excluded in this country. Iím not only running to defeat Donald Trump, I am running to prepare for the day that begins when Donald Trump has left office, to launch the era that must come after Trump."
2019-11-20,Buttigieg,"That era must be characterized not by exclusion, but by belonging, and so must our campaign. I am inviting progressives who have agreed on these issues weíve been talking about tonight all along, moderates who are ready to be part of this coalition, and a lot of future former Republicans, who I know are watching this, disgusted by what is happening in their own party and in this country. I want you to know that everybody is welcome in this movement that weíre building and everybody is welcome in this future that we must create. I hope you go to PeteforAmerica.com, join this effort and help us create a better era for the American people, beginning in November, 2020."
2019-11-20,Sanders,"Thank you. Let me say a word about myself, unusual as it may seem. I am the son of an immigrant, young man of 17, who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket. I have some sense of the immigrant experience. I will stand with the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country. At the age of 21, as a member of a civil rights group at the University of Chicago, I was arrested, spent the night in jail, and I have been committed to the fight against all forms of discrimination, racial discrimination, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, and religious bigotry. I will lead an administration that will look like America, will end the divisiveness brought by Trump and bring us together. During this campaign, I am proud to say that I have received more campaign contributions than any candidate at this point in an election in American history, over four million contributions averaging $18 a piece. If you want to be part of a movement that is not only going to beat Trump, but transform America, that doesnít have a super PAC, doesnít do fundraisers at wealthy peopleís home, please join us at berniesanders.com. Thank you."
2019-11-20,Warren,"Thank you. I listened to this debate tonight and I hear a lot of really good ideas, but I take a look at the issues weíve talked about. Weíve talked about climate change, weíve talked about defense spending, weíve talked about private health insurance. We should have talked about gun violence. What do these issues have in common? Well first, they touch people all over this country in their everyday lives. What is the second thing they have in common? We know what we need to do. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix it and the majority of Americans are with us on it and yet we donít make change. Why not? Because of corruption, because we have a government that works better for big drug companies than it does for people trying to fill a prescription. It works better for a giant defense industry than it does for everyone who worries about the money that goes into arms, instead of into our public schools."
2019-11-20,Warren,"We have a government that works for those at the top and not for anyone else. I have the biggest anti corruption plan since Watergate. It involves ending lobbying as we know it, blocking the revolving door between industry and Washington, making everyone who runs for federal office put their tax returns online. We have to have the courage not to make just individual changes, not to fight for little pieces. We want to make real progress on climate, then we have to start by attacking the corruption that gives the oil industry and other fossil fuel industries a stranglehold over this country."
2019-11-20,Warren,"I am so grateful to be here and I am grateful to an America that gave the daughter of a janitor a chance to become a public school teacher, a chance to become a college professor, a chance to become a United States Senator,-"
2019-11-20,Warren,#NAME?
2019-11-20,Biden,"I assume when weíre talking about the corruption of the federal government, we werenít talking about Barack Obama and his spotless administration who made so much progress. One thing we havenít talked about here today. Weíve talked about everything. We havenít talked about the one thing I think is most consequential. The American people have an enormous opportunity. Thereís incredible Ö Iíve never been more optimistic about our prospects in my entire career and I got elected as a 29 year old kid to the United States Senate. Folks, we are in a position where weíre the wealthiest nation in the world. Our workers are more productive than the workers around the world, three times as productive as workers in Asia."
2019-11-20,Biden,"We have more great research universities that the people own than all the rest of the world combined. Weíre in a position where weíve led not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. Iím so tired of everybody walking around like, woe is me. What are we going to do? Letís remember, this is the United States of America. There has never, ever, ever been a time when we set our mind to do something, weíve been able to do it. Never, never, never. Itís time to remember who we are. Get up. Letís take back this country and lead the world again. Itís within our power to do it. Get up and take it back."
2019-10-15,Warren,"Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. And I think thatís the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didnít think it was going to be about impeachment, but when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown to a fare thee well, that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment I called for opening an impeachment inquiry. Now that didnít happen and look what happened as a result, Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall. You know, we took a constitutional oath and that is that no one is above the law and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump, but understand itís about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward."
2019-10-15,Sanders,"No they donít. In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of this country. Itís not just that he obstructed justice with the Mueller report. I think that the House will find him guilty of worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that and that is outrageous. And I think in terms of the recent Ukrainian incident, the idea that we have a President of the United States who is prepared to hold back national security money to one of our allies in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension. So I look forward, by the way, not only to a speedy and expeditious impeachment process, but Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate."
2019-10-15,Biden,"Yes, they have. I said from the beginning that if in fact Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller report. If they did that, they would have no choice, no choice, but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information. This president and I agree with Bernie, Senator Sanders, is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this President of United States has gone so far as to say since this latest event that in fact he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment. They have no choice but to move."
2019-10-15,Harris,"Well, itís just being observant because he has committed crimes in plain sight. I mean, itís shocking, but he told us who he was. Maya Angelou who told us years ago, listen to somebody when they tell you who they are the first time. During that election, Donald Trump told us he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and get away with it. And he has consistently since he won been selling out the American people. Heís been selling out working people. Heís been selling out our values, heís been selling out national security and on this issue with Ukraine, heís been selling out our democracy. Our framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president. And our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances. This is one of those moments. And so Congress must ask but the reality of it is that I donít really think this impeachment process is going to take very long because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it."
2019-10-15,Harris,"And and he did it in plain sight. He has given us the evidence and he tried to cover it up, putting it in that special server and there has been a clear consciousness of guilt. This will not take very long. Donald Trump needs to be held accountable. He is indeed the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had."
2019-10-15,Booker,"So first of all, we must be fair. We are talking about ongoing proceedings to remove a sitting president for office. This has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship. Look, I share the same sense of urgency of everybody on this stage. I understand the outrage that we all feel, but we have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable, that brings our country together, doesnít rip us apart. Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public, that works to build consensus. Thatís what this nation needs in what is a moral moment and not a political one. So I swore an oath to do my job as a Senator, do my duty. This president has violated his, I will do mine."
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"We can do two things at once, thatís our job. We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America because this President has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests. He has not been standing up for the workers of Ohio. Heís not been standing up for the farmers in Iowa. And I take this even a step further. You know when he made that call to the head of Ukraine, heís digging up dirt on an opponent, thatís illegal conduct. Thatís what he was doing. He didnít talk to them about the Russian invasion, he talked to him about that. So Iím still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes America great again. Iíd like to hear from him about how leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter, where Russia then steps in to protect them, how that makes America great again."
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"And I would like to hear from him about how coddling up to Vladimir Putin makes America great again. It doesnít make America great again, it makes Russia great again. And that is what this President has done. So whether it is workerís issues, whether it is farmerís issue, he has put his own private interests and I will not do that."
2019-10-15,Castro,"Not at all. We can walk and chew gum at the same time and all of us are out there every single day talking about what weíre going to do to make sure that more people cross the graduation stage, that more families have great healthcare, that more folks are put to work in places like Ohio, where Donald Trump has broken his promises. Because Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania, actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them. Not only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller report point out 10 different instances where the President obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is ongoingly, in an ongoing way, violating his oath of office and abusing his power. We have to impeach this President and the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal, he should be removed."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"Well, itís a mistake on the part of Republicans who enabled a president whose actions are as offensive to their own supposed values as they are to the values that we all share. Look, the President has left the Congress with no choice and this is not just about holding the President accountable for not just the things emerging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television. Itís also about the presidency itself because a president, 10 years or 100 years from now, will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion, either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything. But everyone on this stage by definition is competing to be a president for after the Trump presidency. Remember, one way or the other, this presidency is going to come to an end. I want you to picture what itís going to be like, what itís actually going to feel like in this country the first day the sun comes up after Donald Trump has been president."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"It starts out feeling like a happy thought. This particular brand of chaos and corruption will be over, but really think about where weíll be, vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now. And these big issues, from the economy to climate change have not taken a vacation during the impeachment process. Iím running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country while tackling those issues that are going to be just as urgent then as they are now."
2019-10-15,Gabbard,"If impeachment is driven by these hyper-partisan interests, it will only further divide an already terribly divided country. Unfortunately, this is what weíve already seen play out as calls for impeachment really began shortly after Trump won his election. And as unhappy as that may make us as Democrats, he won that election in 2016. The serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House and I think that it should continue to play its course out together. All the information, provide that to the American people, recognizing that that is the only way forward. If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford."
2019-10-15,Steyer,"Well, Anderson, this is my first time on this stage, so I just want to start by reminding everybody that every candidate here is more decent, more coherent, and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House. But I also want to point out that Andersonís right, two years ago, I started the Need To Impeach movement because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. That we did have the most corrupt president in the country, and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency. So in fact, impeaching and removing this President is something that the American people are demanding. Theyíre the voice that counts and thatís who I went to, the American people."
2019-10-15,Yang,"I support impeachment, but we shouldnít have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will one be successful or two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016. Weíre standing in the great state of Ohio, the ultimate purple state, the ultimate bellwether state. Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points? Because we got rid of 300,000 manufacturing jobs in your towns and weíre not stopping there. How many of you have noticed stores closing where you work and live here in Ohio? Raise your hands. Itís not just you, Amazon alone as closing 30% of Americaís stores in malls soaking up $20 billion in business while paying zero in taxes. These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected, the fourth industrial revolution and that is going to accelerate and grow more serious regardless of who is in the Oval Office. The fact is, Donald Trump, when weíre talking about him, we are losing. We need to present a new vision and that even includes talking about impeaching Donald Trump."
2019-10-15,Biden,"Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And thatís what we should be focusing on. And what I wanted to make a point about and my sonís statement speaks for itself, he spoke about it today. My sonís statement speaks for itself. What I think is important is we focus on why itís so important to remove this man from office. On the 17th Ö look, the fact that George Washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president, that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections. It was the greatest threat to America."
2019-10-15,Biden,"This president on three occasions, three occasions has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the President and his thugs have already proven that they in fact are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesnít want me to be the candidate. Heís going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum."
2019-10-15,Biden,"Look, my sonís statement speaks for itself. I did my job, I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. Weíve always kept everything separate. Even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed any, so thereíd be no potential conflict. My son made a judgment. Iím proud of the judgment he made. Iím proud of what he had to say and letís focus on this, the fact of the matter is that this is about Trumpís corruption. Thatís what we should be focusing on."
2019-10-15,Sanders,Let me make a point. I think that it is absolutely imperative to go forward with impeachment. I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster if the American people believed that all we were doing is taking on Trump and weíre forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or under insured. Weíre forgetting about the existential threat of climate change. We are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. So what we have got to do is end this corruption set a precedent for future history that says presidents like this cannot behave this way. But we cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country.
2019-10-15,Booker,It is wrong to move on.
2019-10-15,Warren,"So I have made clear what my principles are here and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and for hardworking, middle class families, costs will go down. You know, the way I see this is I have been out all around this country. Iíve done 140 town halls now. Been to 27 States and Puerto Rico, shoot, I have done 70,000 selfies, which must be the new measure of democracy. And this gives people a chance to come up and talk to me directly. So Iíve talked with the family, the mom and dad whose daughterís been diagnosed with cancer. I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes. Iíve talked to the young man who has M.S. And hereís the thing about all of them, they all had great health insurance right at the beginning. But then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing."
2019-10-15,Warren,"Look, the way I see this, it is hard enough to get a diagnosis that your child has cancer. To think about the changes in your family, if your momís got diabetes or what it means for your life going forward if youíve been diagnosed with M.S. But what you shouldnít have to worry about is how youíre going to pay for your healthcare after that."
2019-10-15,Warren,"So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy, they will go up for big corporations and for middle class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"Well, we heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didnít get a yes or no answer. This is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature Senator, is to have a plan for everything except this, no plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is we really can deliver healthcare for every American and move forward with the boldest, biggest transformation since the inception of Medicare itself. But the way to do it without a giant multi-trillion dollar hole and without having to avoid a yes or no question is Medicare for All who want it. We take a version of Medicare, we let you access it if you want to. And if you prefer to stay on your private plan, you can do that too. That is what most Americans want. Medicare for all who want it, trusting you to make the right decision for your healthcare and for your family. And it can be delivered without [crosstalk 00:23:00]"
2019-10-15,Warren,"So letís be clear, whenever someone hears the term Medicare for All who want it, understand what that really means. Itís Medicare for All who can afford it, and thatís the problem weíve got. Medicare for All is the gold standard. It is the way we get healthcare coverage for every single American, including the family whose childís been diagnosed with cancer, including the person whoís just gotten an M.S. diagnosis. Thatís how we make sure that everyone gets healthcare. We can pay for this, Iíve laid out the basic principles. Costs are going to go up for the wealthy, theyíre going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle class families and I will not sign a bill into law that raises their costs because costs are what people care about. Iíve been studying this for the biggest part of my life, why people go bankrupt."
2019-10-15,Warren,Sure.
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"I donít think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice and the choice of Medicare for All who want it, which is affordable for everyone because we make sure that the subsidies are in place, allows you to get that healthcare. Itís just better than Medicare for All whether you want it or not. And I donít understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years, when we could achieve that same big bold goal. And once again, weíre competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be horrifyingly polarized even more than now. After everything weíve been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be even more divided. Why unnecessarily divide this country over healthcare when thereís a better way to deliver coverage for all."
2019-10-15,Warren,Iíd like to be able to respond-
2019-10-15,Sanders,"As somebody who wrote the damn bill as I said. Letís be clear on the Medicare for All bill that I wrote, premiums are gone, co-payments are gone, deductibles are gone. All out of pocket expenses are gone. Weíre going to do better than the Canadianís doing, that is what they have managed to do. At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their healthcare bills. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. Theyíre going to go up significantly for the wealthy and for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less, substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out of pocket expenses."
2019-10-15,Warren,"My view on this and what I have committed to, is costs will go down for hardworking middle class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for All who can afford it, that will leave behind millions of people who cannot. And I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says, ìSorry, weíre not covering your expensive cancer treatments. Weíre not covering your expensive treatments for M.S. Weíre not covering what covering what you need.î"
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"At least Bernieís being honest here and saying how heís going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up and Iím sorry Elizabeth, but you have not said that and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where weíre going to send the invoice. I believe the best and boldest idea here is to not trash Obamacare but to do exactly what Barack Obama wanted to do from the beginning and thatís have a public option that would bring down the cost of the premium and expand the number of people covered and take on the pharmaceutical companies. That is what we should be doing instead of kicking 149 million people off their insurance in four years. And Iím tired of hearing whenever I say these things, ìOh, itís Republican talking points.î You are making Republican talking points right now in this room by coming out for a plan thatís going to do that. I think there is a better way that is bold that will cover more people and itís the one we should get behind."
2019-10-15,Warren,"Yeah, I didnít spend most of my time in Washington. I spent most of my time studying one basic question and that is why hardworking people go broke. And one of the principle reasons for that is the cost of healthcare. And back when I was studying it, two out of every three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance. The problem weíve got right now is the overall cost of healthcare. And look, you can try to spin this any way you want. Iíve spent my entire life on working on how Americaís middle class has been hollowed out and how we fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is weíve got stop Americans from going bankrupt over healthcare costs."
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"Yes I do and I appreciate Elizabethís work. But again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done and we can get this public option done and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices. But what really bothers me about this discussion, which weíve had so many times, is that we donít talk about the things that Iím hearing about from regular Americans that is longterm care. We are seeing, I once called it a silver tsunami, the aging, and then someone told me that was too negative. So I call it the silver surge, the aging of the population. We need to make it easier to get longterm care insurance and strengthen Medicaid. In this state, the state of Ohio that has been hit by the opioid epidemic, we need to take on those pharma companies and make them pay for the addictions that they have caused and the people that they have killed. Those are the issues that I hear about when Iím in Toledo [crosstalk 00:29:07]"
2019-10-15,Biden,"First of all, the plan weíre hearing discussed is the Biden plan, the one I put forward, build on Obamacare, at public option. We can go into that, I can talk about that if youíd like. But hereís the deal, on the single most important thing facing the American public, I think itís awfully important to be straightforward with them. The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget and we talk about how weíre going to pay for it. The study recently came out showing that in fact it will reduce costs, but for people making between $50 and $75,000 year, their taxes are going to go up about $5,000 because the fact is theyíll pay more in new taxes, 7.4% plus or 5% plus a 4% income tax. If a fireman and a schoolteacher are making 100,000 bucks a year, their taxes are going to go up about 10 grand. That is more than they will possibly say on this healthcare plan. We have a plan put forward that will work."
2019-10-15,Sanders,"I get a little bit tired, I must say, of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel. 87 million uninsured, 30,000 people dying every single year, 500,000 people going bankrupt. For what reason, they came down with cancer. I will tell you what the issue is here. The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the healthcare industry, which made $100 billion in profit. Whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt price fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. And if we donít have the guts to do that, if all we could do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves."
2019-10-15,Harris,"This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word with all of these discussions about healthcare on womenís access to reproductive healthcare, which itís under full on attack in America today, and itís outrageous. There are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive healthcare. And it is not an exaggeration to say women will die, poor women, women of color will die because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies. Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of womenís bodies and let women make the-"
2019-10-15,Harris,"Ö country, people need to keep their hands off of womenís bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives."
2019-10-15,Harris,Letís talk about that. That is a significant healthcare issue in America today.
2019-10-15,Sanders,"Damn right, we will, and Iíll tell you why. If you look up what goes on in America today, we have an infrastructure which is collapsing. We can put 15 million people to work rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our wastewater plants, airports, et cetera. Furthermore, and I hope we will discuss it at length tonight, this planet faces the greatest threat in its history from climate change, and the Green New Deal that I have advocated will create up to 20 million jobs as we move away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. We need workers to do childcare. We need workers, great teachers to come in to school systems which donít have the teachers that we need right now. We need more doctors, we need more dentists, we need more carpenters, we need more sheet metal metalworkers. When we talk about making public colleges and universities tuition-free and canceling student debt, weíre going to give those people the opportunity to get those good jobs."
2019-10-15,Yang,"I am for the spirit of a federal jobs guarantee, but you have to look at how it would actually materialize in practice. What are the jobs? Who manages you? What if you donít like your job? What if youíre not good at your job? The fact is, most Americans do not want to work for the federal government and saying that that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century, to me, is not a vision that most Americans would embrace."
2019-10-15,Yang,"Also, Senator Sandersí description of a federal jobs guarantee does not take into account the work of people like my wife, whoís at home with our two boys, one of whom is autistic. We have a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month. It actually recognizes the work that is happening in our families and our communities. It helps all Americans transition, because the fact is, and you know this in Ohio, if you rely upon the federal government to target its resources, you wind up with failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants. When we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle-up economy from our people, our families, and our communities up. It will enable us to do the kind of work that we want to do. This is the sort of positive vision in response to the Fourth Industrial Revolution that we have to embrace as a party."
2019-10-15,Booker,"Well, first of all, Iím happy to get in, finally. I just want to say, as a great New Jerseyan, Yogi Berra, said, ìI am having deja vu all over again.î Iím having days of Google all over again, first of all, because I saw this play in 2016ís election. We are literally using Donald Trumpís lies, and the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That was so offensive. He should not have to defend ourselves. The only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump, seeing that weíre distracting from his malfeasance and the selling out of his office."
2019-10-15,Booker,"Iím having deja vu all over again because we have another healthcare debate and weíre not talking about the clear and existential threat in America that weíre in a state that has had two Planned Parenthoods close. We are seeing, all over this country, womenís reproductive rights under attack. God bless Kamala, but you know what? Women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight. Men-"

2019-10-15,Booker,#NAME?
2019-10-15,Warren,"The data show that weíve had a lot of problems with losing jobs, but the principle reason has been bad trade policy. The principle reason has been a bunch of corporations, giant multinational corporations who have been calling the shots on trade, giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty to America. They have no loyalty to American workers. They have no loyalty to American consumers. They have no loyalty to American communities. They are loyal only to their own bottom line."
2019-10-15,Warren,"I have a plan to fix that, and itís accountable capitalism. It says, ìYou want to have one of the giant corporations in America? Then, by golly, 40% of your board of directors should be elected by your employees.î Thatíll make a difference. When a corporation decides, ìGee, we can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico,î when there are people on the board in the board room saying, ìNo. Do you know what that does to our company? Do you know what that does to our community, what it does to our workers?î We also need to make it easier to join a union and give unions more power when they negotiate. We need to restructure strength in this economy and thatís where it starts."
2019-10-15,Castro,"Well, I think what folks have said is that that is only part of the issue, right? Yeah, I believe that we need to address communities that are being impacted by automation. Iím even willing to pilot something like UBI and to see how that would work, but I think we need to focus on making sure that we spark job opportunity for people across this country. As I mentioned earlier, here in Ohio, in the latest job data, Ohio is losing jobs under Donald Trump. He has broken his promises to Ohio and the industrial Midwest. I would invest in infrastructure to put people back to work. I would invest in a Green New Deal to unleash millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy."
2019-10-15,Castro,"I was in Newton, Iowa a few weeks ago and I visited a place called TPI. Newton, Iowa had a Maytag washing machine manufacturing facility, and then it closed down. TPI manufacturers wind turbines. Theyíre putting hundreds of people to work at decent paying jobs and creating a better future for those families. On top of that, let me just say this, we need to support working families. We need to invest in things like universal childcare-"
2019-10-15,Castro,-so that people can afford childcare instead of having to pay 20% of their income for it.
2019-10-15,Yang,"Senator Warren. I just need to address this. Senator Warren, Iíve been talking-"
2019-10-15,Yang,"-to Americans around the country about automation, and theyíre smart. They see whatís happening around them. Their Main Street stores are closing. They see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonaldís, every grocery store, every CVS. Driving a truck as the most common job in 29 States, including this one. Three and a half million truck drivers in this country, and my friends in California are piloting self driving trucks. What does that going to mean for the three and a half million truckers or the seven million Americans who work in truck stops, motels, and diners that rely upon the truckers getting out and having a meal? Saying this is a rules problem is ignoring the reality that Americans see around us every single day."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,This is exactly what I said.
2019-10-15,Warren,"I understand that what weíre all looking for is how we strengthen Americaís middle class. Actually, I think the thing closest to the universal basic income is Social Security. Itís one of the reasons that I put forward a plan to extend the solvency of Social Security by decades and add $200 to the payment of every person who receives Social Security right now and every person who receives disability insurance right now. That $200 a month will lift nearly 5 million families out of poverty and it will sure loosen up the budget for a whole lot more. It also has a provision for your wife, for those who stay home to do caregiving for children or for seniors, and creates an opportunity for them to get credit on their Social Security."
2019-10-15,Warren,"So after a lifetime of hard work, people are entitled to retire with dignity."
2019-10-15,Warren,"I see this is an important question, but I want to understand the data on this."
2019-10-15,Warren,I want to make sure weíre responding to make this work.
2019-10-15,Yang,I have the data.
2019-10-15,Gabbard,"Thank you. You know, really what this is about is getting to the heart of the fear that is well founded. As people look to this automation revolution, they look to uncertainty. They donít know how this is going to affect their jobs and their everyday lives. I agree with my friend Andrew Yang. I think universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so that people can have the freedom to make the kinds of choices that they want to see. This has to do with bad trade deals that weíve seen in the past, that have also driven fear towards people losing the way that they provide for their families. Really what we need to do is look at how we can best serve the interests of the American people. I do not believe a federal jobs guarantee is the way to do that. The value that someone feels in themselves and their own lives is not defined by the job that they have, but is intrinsic to who we all are as Americans, whatever we choose to do with our lives, and we canít forget that."
2019-10-15,Booker,"Well, first of all, the one point I wanted to make about the UBI conversation, and I hope that my friend Andrew Yang will come out for thisÖ Doing more for workers than UBI would actually be just raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. It would put more money in peopleís pockets than giving them $1,000 a month. We have to start putting the dignity back in work. Number one, you start having trade deals. Not like this thing that the president is trying to push through Congress right now that gives pharmaceutical companies and other corporations benefits and doesnít put workers at the center of every trade deal. We must make sure we are not giving corporate tax incentives for people to move jobs out of our country, but start to put the worker at the center of that and make sure that they have the resources to succeed."
2019-10-15,Booker,"But itís more than that. I stood with these workers because weíre seeing this trend all over our country. I stood with unions because right now, unions in America are under attack. As union membership has gone down, we have seen a stratification of wealth and income in this country. So the other thing that Iíll do as president of the United States is begin to fight again to see union strength in this country spread, to make sure we have sectorial bargaining so that unions from the auto workers all the way to fast food workers can ensure that we improve workersí conditions and make sure that every American has a living wage in this country."
2019-10-15,Sanders,"When you have a half a million Americans sleeping out on the street today, when you have 87 million people uninsured or under-insured, when youíve got hundreds of thousands of kids who cannot afford to go to college and millions struggling with the oppressive burden of student debt, and then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society, that is a moral and economic outrage. The truth is, we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality and we cannot afford a billionaire class whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for 45 years. If you are asking me, do I think we should demand that the wealthy start payingÖ the wealthiest, top one-tenth of 1%Ö start paying their fair share of taxes so we can create a nation and a government that works for all of us? Yes, thatís exactly what I believe."
2019-10-15,Steyer,Ha.
2019-10-15,Steyer,"Well, first of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people, and specifically on organized labor. The results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. Itís absolutely wrong. Itís absolutely undemocratic and unfair. I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations."
2019-10-15,Steyer,"But thereís something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and thatís the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings. As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people havenít had a raise. 90% of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years. If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get 11 bucks. Itís seven and a quarter. If you included the productivity gains of American workers, itíd be over 20 bucks. Thereís something wrong here, and that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. Thatís why Iím running for president, because weíre not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wantsÖ healthcare, education, Green New Deal, or a living wage-"
2019-10-15,Steyer,#NAME?
2019-10-15,Biden,"No, look. Demonizing wealthy people. What I talked about is how you get things done. The way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. We have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would eliminate the capital gains tax thatÖ I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5%. I would double it, because guess what? Why in Godís name should someone whoís clipping coupons in the stock market makeÖ in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who, in fact, isÖ like I said, a school teacher and a firefighter. Itís ridiculous, and they pay a lower tax."
2019-10-15,Biden,"Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are thereís $1 trillion, $640 billion in tax loopholes. You canít justify a minimum $600 billion of that. We can eliminate it all. I could go into detail, had I the time. Thirdly, what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. Weíre going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not. This is one of the reasons why these debates kind of crazy. Because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybodyís right about the fact that the Fourth Industrial Revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed. If theyíre going back, theyíre not investing in their employees. Theyíre reinvesting and buying back their stock."
2019-10-15,Biden,"See, Iím doing the same thing."
2019-10-15,Warren,"I think this is about our values as a country. Show me your budget, show me your tax plans, and weíll know what your values are. Right now in America, the top one tenth of 1% have so much wealth, understand this, that if we put a two-cent tax on their 50,000,001st dollar and on every dollar after that, we would have enough money to provide universal childcare for every baby in this country age zero to five, universal pre-K for every child, raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America, provide for universal tuition-free college, put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities-"
2019-10-15,Warren,"-and cancelÖ No, let me finish pleaseÖ and cancel student loan debt for 95% of the people who have it.

Let me tell you, though, how this looks from the industrial Midwest where I live. Washington politicians, congressmen, and senators saying all the right things, offering the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes. I didnít even realize it was unusual to have empty factories that I would see out the windows of my dadís Chevy Cavalier when he drove me to school. I didnít know that wasnít every city until I went away to college. Now I drive my own Chevy. Itís a Chevy Cruze. Used to be built right in Lordstown, which is now one more symbol of the broken promises that this president has made to workers. But why did workers take a chance on this president in the first place? Itís because it felt like nobody was willing to actually do anything, and while heís unquestionably made it dramatically worse, this is time to realize that weíre paying attention to the wrong things. Weíre paying attention-"

2019-10-15,Klobuchar,I want to give a reality-
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"It could work. I am open to it, but I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires. We just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea. When I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, ìGuess what, you guys all got a lot richer.î That was the one time in his presidency he told the truth. We have different ways. I would repeal significant portions of that tax bill that helped the rich, including what he did with the corporate tax rate, including what he did on international taxation. You add it all up, you got a lot of money that one, helps pay for that childcare, protects that dignity of work, makes sure we have decent retirement and makes sure that our kids can go to good schools."
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,It is not one idea that rules here.
2019-10-15,Warren,"Understand, taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way tax and wealth does, that the rich are not like you and me. The really, really billionaires are making their money off their accumulated wealth and it just keeps growing. We need a wealth tax in order to make investments in the next generation. Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats, we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started."
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"Oh, I would like to respond to that."
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"I think simply because you have different ideas doesnít mean youíre fighting for regular people. I wouldnít even be up on this stage if it wasnít for unions and the dignity of work. If my grandpa didnít have unions protecting him in those mines, he wouldnít have survived. If my mom didnít have unions as a teacher, she wouldnít have been able to make the wages she made when my parents got divorced. Just because we have different ideas and get to the same place in terms of beating Donald Trump and taking this onÖ We are in Ohio, we can win Ohio and the presidency, but only if we unite, if we unite around ideals and donít go fighting against each other, and instead take the fight to him."
2019-10-15,Harris,Right.
2019-10-15,Harris,"Well, hereís how I think about it. When I was growing up, my mother raised my sister and me. We would often come home from school before she came home from work. Sheíd come home, sheíd cook dinner, and at some point weíd go to bed and sheíd sit up at the kitchen table, trying to figure out how to make it all work. When I think about where we are right now in 2020, I do believe justices on the ballot. Itís on the ballot in terms of impeachment. Itís on the ballot in terms of economic justice, health justice, and so many other issues. When I think about this issue, Iím thinking about that dad, who tonight is going to be sitting his kitchen table after everyoneís gone to sleep, and sitting there with his cup of tea or coffee, trying to figure out how heís going to make it work. Heís probably sitting there deciding that on that minimum wage job that does not pay enough for him to meet the bills at the end of the month, heís going to have to start driving an Uber."
2019-10-15,Harris,"What does that mean? That means that with those two jobs, heís going to miss his kidsí soccer games. Thatís the reality for Americans today, which is why yes, when I get elected and and pass this bill, which will give the American family who makes less than $100,000 a year a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year that they can take home at up to $500 a month, thatís going to make a real difference in that manís life. Donít tell him thatís not a big deal-"

2019-10-15,Yang,"Senator Warren is 100% right that weíre in the midst of the most extreme winner-take-all economy in history, and a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle. The problem is that itís been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all of those countries ended up repealing it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that theyíd projected. If we canít learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from? We should not be looking to other countriesí mistakes. Instead, we should look at what Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden still have, which is a value-added tax. If we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot truck mile, every Facebook ad, we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands, because we know best how to use it."
2019-10-15,Steyer,"Erin, let me say, this is a-"
2019-10-15,Warren,"Iím really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks Iím punitive. Look, I donít have a beef with billionaires. My problem is, you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you. But you built that fortune in America, I guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You built it in part getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for. All Iím saying is, you make it to the top, the top one-tenth of 1%, then pitch in two cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it."

2019-10-15,Warren,"That is the point. This is universal childcare for every baby in this country. Early educational opportunities for every child. Universal pre-K, no matter where you live, for every three-year-old and four-year-old. Raising the wages-"
2019-10-15,Warren,"No. Raising the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country. This is about universal college, about investment in our HBCUs, about making sure that we get rid of the student loan debt burden-"
2019-10-15,Warren,-that is crushing 43 million American-
2019-10-15,Castro,"Thanks a lot, Erin. You see that everybody has their own plans. Let me just say that the way that I view this is born out of my own experience. I grew up like I bet a lot of folks in this room grew up, and folks that are watching on TV. I grew up with my twin brother walking in a single parent household where my mom was working hard to support us and also her mom, my grandmother, and we knew what it was like a to wonder whether weíre going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month or sometimes have the electricity turned off and when I was a kid to look at the grocery list that seemed to get shorter and shorter and thatís whatís happening to a lot of families these days."
2019-10-15,Castro,"I was in Las Vegas a few months ago and I visited people who are homeless, who are living in storm drainage tunnels under the Las Vegas Strip in the shadow of hotels and casinos that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, where people from around the world are spending so much money on vacations. We can do better than that. I believe that a wealth inequality tax, as Iíve proposed, is part of the answer, but also Iíve proposed an inheritance tax, raising the top marginal tax rate-"

2019-10-15,Booker,"Well, first of all, I just want to respond byÖ You know, weíve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president. How we talk about each other in this debate actually, really matters. Iíve had the privilege of working with or being friends with everybody on this stage, and tearing each other down because we have a different plan, to me, is unacceptable. I have seen this script before. It didnít work in 2016 and it will be disaster for us in 2020."
2019-10-15,Booker,"I have a different plan than Elizabeth Warren. I have a different plan than many people on this stage. It involves, again, fair taxes for the richest. We have a lot of work to do there, but weíve had 20 years of presidential debates and we have never talked about the violence in America of child poverty. We have got to begin to talk more eloquently and more persuasively and urgently about doing the things not just to make sure a fair taxes are paid by people on the top, but that we deal with the moral obscenity of having the highest levels of child poverty in the industrial world. My plan will focus on that, and these are some of the issues we should be talking about, not defining ourselves just by what weíre against, but we need to win this election by talking about who and what we are for."
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,Amen.
2019-10-15,Biden,"I would not have withdrawn the troops, and I would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops who are in Iraq, which are in retreat now, being fired on by Assadís people, and the President of the United States saying, ìIf those ISIS folks escape from the prisons theyíre in, theyíll only go to Europe. It wonít affect us.î It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history, excuse me, in terms of foreign policy. And the fact of the matter is, Iíve never seen a time, and I spent thousands of hours in the situation room, Iíve spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq, and guess what? Our commanders, across the board, former and present are ashamed of whatís happening here."
2019-10-15,Biden,"What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, heís going to have a problem because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdogan, and letting him know that heís going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now, pay that price."
2019-10-15,Biden,"I would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that theyíre not going anywhere, and have them protected, and work my way back toward what in fact needs to be done, protecting those Kurds. They lost their lives. This is shameful, shameful what this man has done."
2019-10-15,Gabbard,"Oh, first of all, weíve got to understand the reality of the situation there, which is that the slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war that weíve been waging in Syria. Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media who have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war."
2019-10-15,Gabbard,"Not only that, but New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war. Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that Iím a Russian asset, and an Assad apologist, and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that Iím an asset of Russia. Completely despicable."
2019-10-15,Gabbard,"As president, I will end these regime change wars by doing two things: ending the draconian sanctions that are really a modern day siege, the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen that have caused tens and thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve; and I would make sure that we stop supporting terrorists like Al-Qaeda in Syria who have been the ground force in this ongoing regime change war."
2019-10-15,Gabbard,"Iíd like to ask Senator Warren if she would join me in calling for an end to this regime change war in Syria, finally?"
2019-10-15,Warren,"So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I donít think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this President has done is that he has sucked up to dictators, he has made impulsive decisions that often his own team doesnít understand, he has cut and run on our allies, and he has enriched himself at the expense of the United States of America. In Syria, he has created a bigger than ever humanitarian crisis, he has helped ISIS get another foothold, a new lease on life. I sit on the Armed Services Committee, I talk with our military leaders about this."
2019-10-15,Warren,I was in Iraq and went through the neighborhoods that ISIS destroyed. We need to get out-
2019-10-15,Warren,Ö but we need to do this through a negotiated solution.
2019-10-15,Warren,There is no military solution-
2019-10-15,Warren,Ö in this region.
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"Well, respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong. The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, itís a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal, by this President, of American allies and American values. Look, I didnít think we shouldíve gone to Iraq in the first place, I think we need to get out of Afghanistan, but itís also the case that a small number of specialized special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what weíre seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide, and the resurgence of ISIS."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"Meanwhile, soldiers in the field are reporting that, for the first time, they feel ashamed, ashamed of what their country has done. We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms, asking what the hell happened to American leadership? And when I was deployed, I knew one of the things keeping me safe was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country known to keep its word, and our allies knew it, and our enemies lose that."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"You take that away, you are taking away what makes America America."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,It makes our troops and the world a much more dangerous place.
2019-10-15,Gabbard,"Yeah, absolutely. So really what youíre saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war that has caused so many refugees to flee Syria, that you would continue to have our country involved in a war that has undermined our national security, you would continue this policy of the U.S. actually providing arms and support to terrorist groups in Syria, like Al-Qaeda, HTS, Al-Nusra, and others because they are the ones who have been the ground force in this regime change war. Thatís really what youíre saying."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"No, you can embrace, or you can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trumpís policy as youíre doing."
2019-10-15,Gabbard,Will you end the regime change war is the question?
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,What we are doing-
2019-10-15,Gabbard,"What is an endless war, if itís not yet another regime change war?"
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"What we are doing, or what we were doing in Syria was keeping our word. Part of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up too. When I was deployed, not just the Afghan National Army Forces, but the janitors put their lives on the line just by working with U.S. Forces. I would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there. And it is undermining the honor of our soldiers. You take away-"
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"Ö the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next. This President has betrayed American values-"
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,Ö our credibility is in tatter. I will restore U.S. credibility before it is finally too late.
2019-10-15,Sanders,"Iím sorry, say that again?"
2019-10-15,Sanders,"No, Turkey is not a U.S. ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter. The crisis here, as I think Joe said and Pete said, is when you begin to betray people Ö And in terms of the Kurds, 11,000 of them died fighting ISIS, 20,000 were wounded. And the United States said, ìWe are with you. Weíre standing with you.î And then suddenly one day, after a phone call with Erdogan, announced by tweet, Trump reverses that policy. Now you tell me, what country in the world will trust the word of the President of the United States? In other words, what he has done is wreck our ability to do foreign policy, to do military policy because nobody in the world will believe this pathological liar."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"But this is really important, because what this President has done shows that American leadership shapes the behavior of our allies, or sometimes allies too. Remember, the problem right now is not just with our competitors. In for example, a place like China, the people of Hong Kong rise up for democracy, and donít get a peep of support from the President. Itís not just the behavior of adversaries like Russia, but our one-time allies like Saudi Arabia, which the CIA just concluded was responsible, as we all knew, for murdering and dismembering an American resident and journalist, and Turkey, which was an American ally. Thatís the point. We had leverage, but when we abandoned the international stage, when we think our only choices are between endless war or total isolation, the consequence is-"
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"Ö the disappearance of U.S. leadership from the world stage, and that makes this entire world a more dangerous place."
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"We need to work with our allies to work with Turkey and bring them out. This is an outrageous thing that happened here, and I think we need to talk about this a not only in terms of the horror of what happened here with Turkey, but the fact that our President blew it, and now heís too proud to say it, and what do we do now? We continue that humanitarian aid, but then we work with our allies to say, ìCome back, Turkey, and stop this.î Because what Mayor Pete has just said is true. Think about our other allies, Israel. How do they feel right now? Donald Trump is not true to his word when they are a beacon of democracy in the Mid-East. Think about our allies in Europe when he pulls out of the Iranian agreement, and leaves them holding the bag, and gives the power to China and Russia."
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,Think about the nuclear agreement with Russia that he precipitously pulled out of. This is part of a pattern. Itís not an isolated incident.
2019-10-15,Harris,"Thatís a great question, Anderson, because the Commander in Chief of the United States of America has, as one of her greatest priorities and responsibilities, to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland. I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I have over a period of time received classified information about the threats to our security, and hotspots around the world."
2019-10-15,Harris,"What has happened in Syria is yet again Donald Trump selling folks out. And in this case, he sold out the Kurds, who, yes, fought with us and thousands died in our fight against ISIS. And letís be clear, what Donald Trump has done because of that phone call with Erdogan is basically giving 10,000 ISIS fighters a get out of jail free card. And you know who the winner is in this? There are four: Russia, Iran, Assad, and ISIS. This is a crisis of Donald Trumpís making, and it is on a long list of crises of Donald Trumpís making. And thatís why dude got to go, and when I am Commander in Chief, we will stop this madness."
2019-10-15,Castro,"Well, I mean you asked the question of how are we going to get people to trust us again? The first thing is weíve got to boot Donald Trump out of the Oval Office so that people will trust us again. You know, I also want people to think, the folks this week that saw those images of ISIS prisoners running free, to think about how absurd it is that this President is caging kids on the border, and effectively letting ISIS prisoners run free. He has made a tremendous mistake, a total disaster there in Syria."
2019-10-15,Castro,"And just to connect the dots for a second, if youíre Kim Jong Un, for instance, why in the world would you believe anything that this President says to contain your nuclear weapons program when he tore up an Iran nuclear agreement that we just signed four years ago, which was the strongest agreement to contain Iranís nuclear weapons program, and now heís abandoned the very people that we gave our word to?"
2019-10-15,Castro,I would make sure that we work with our allies to pressure Syria-
2019-10-15,Castro,"Ö to stop the aggression, and I support efforts at stronger sanctions than this president has announced."
2019-10-15,Booker,"So first of all, understand that this president is turning the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire. We literally have great generals, like Mattis, who said on the world stage, ìThe United States of America. There can be no better friend than the United States of America, and no greater enemy than the United States of America.î This President has turned that upside down, and now is doing things to undermine our critical alliances, and partner with Russia."
2019-10-15,Booker,"And so clearly, to your question, number one, we cannot allow the Russians to continue to grow and influence by abandoning the world stage. We cannot allow Russia to not only interfere in the democracies of the Ukraine, and Latvia, and Lithuania, but even not calling them out for their efforts to interfere in this democracy are unacceptable. Russia and Putin understand strength, and this President, time and time again, is showing moral weakness."
2019-10-15,Booker,"He makes promises to the American people, that heís going to protect this nation. Well, instead of doing something to defeat ISIS, heís now given them a foothold again. This is an American President that even right now is lying to the American public and saying heís bringing our troops home. At the same time, heís increasing true presence with the Saudis while theyíre involved in an unjust war that is killing tens of thousands of children in Yemen. This president is making us less safe. He is partnering more with Putin than he is with Merkel and Macron. As President of the United States, I will stop this and restore American integrity abroad."
2019-10-15,Biden,"I think I may be, doesnít make me any better or worse, but may be the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin, as well as with Erdogan. And Erdogan understands that Ö You talk about should he stay in or out of NATO? He understands that heís out of NATO, heís in real trouble. But the fact of the matter is we have been one willing in this administration because we have an erratic, crazy President who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy, and operates out of fear for his own reelection. Think whatís happened. The fact of the matter is you have Russia influencing and trying to break up NATO. What does the president do? He says, ìI believe Vladimir Putin. I donít believe our intelligence community.î"
2019-10-15,Sanders,Are you suggesting Iím Vladimir Putin?
2019-10-15,Biden,"No, no, Iím not. No, no, Iím not. Iím not. Iím not."
2019-10-15,Sanders,I know.
2019-10-15,Biden,"Iím not. But here, look, but hereís the deal. Think what that did. He turns around, and he questions whether or not heíll keep the sacred commitment of Article 5 for the NATO members. If he is reelected, I promise you, there will be no NATO. Our security will be vastly underrated, under Ö We will be in real trouble."
2019-10-15,Biden,"And with regard to regime change in Syria, that has not been the policy, weíd change the regime. It has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds and thousands of innocent people between there and the Iraqi border. And lastly, and I apologize for going up, but lastly, what is happening in Iraq is going to, I mean excuse me, in Afghanistan as well as all the way over to Syria, we have ISIS, itís going to come here. They are going to, in fact, damage the United States of America. Thatís why we got involved in the first place, and not ceded the whole area to Assad and to the Russians."
2019-10-15,Steyer,"Absolutely. As far as Iím concerned, Mr. Trumpís America first program, which involves having no plans, having no process, and having no partners is proved to be a disaster in Syria, itís proved to be a disaster in terms of our response to Russiaís attacking our democracy, and more than that, when we look at the problems around the world, the idea that the United States is going to act unilaterally against a country without the support of our traditional allies makes absolutely no sense."
2019-10-15,Steyer,"Letís go to the most important international problem that weíre facing, which no one has brought up, which is climate. We canít solve the climate crisis in the United States by ourselves. Itís an international crisis. Iíve been working on it for 10 years, taking on the corporations. But we have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the world. So if you look at what Mr. Trump is doing, of course heís been bought by the oil and gas companies. But any problem that weíre going to do, but specifically climate, weíre going to have to lead the world morally, weíre going to have to lead it technologically, financially, and commercially. This is the proof that this kind of America first, go it alone, trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea Iíve ever heard, and I would change it on day one in every single light."
2019-10-15,Yang,"Of course. We have to look at the chain of events. How did we get here? The fact is, we were falling apart at home, so we voted in Donald Trump, and heís now led us down this dangerous path with erratic and unreliable foreign policy. We have to let Russia know, ìLook, we get it. Weíve tampered with other elections. Youíve tampered with our elections. And now it has to stop. And if it does not stop, we will take this as an act of hostility against the American people.î I believe most Americans would support me on this."
2019-10-15,Yang,"But Russian hacking of our democracy is an illustration of the 21st century threats: artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, climate change, loose nuclear material, military drones and non-state actors. These are the threats that are going to require our administration to catch up in terms of technology. We all know we are decades behind the curve on technology. We saw when Mark Zuckerberg testified at Congress, the nature of the questioning. As Commander in Chief, I will help pull us forward-"
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"Marc, I want to respond-"
2019-10-15,Yang,Ö and thatís going to be a huge responsibility of the next president.
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"I want to respond to Mr. Yang. I donít see a moral equivalency between our country and Russia. Vladimir Putin is someone who has shot down planes over Ukraine, who has poisoned his opponent, and we have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from Russia invading our election. This wasnít meddling. Thatís what I do when I call my daughter on a Saturday night and ask her what sheís doing. Sorry."
2019-10-15,Biden,He has no soul.
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"This was much more serious than that. This was actually invading our election. So to protect ourselves in 2020, what we need, one, backup paper ballots in every single state. That is the bill that I need, and we need to stop Mitch McConnell from stopping that from happening. And then we need to stop the social media companies from running paid political ads, including ones last time in rubles, without having to say where those ads came from and who paid for them. Thatís the Honest Ads Act, thatís a bipartisan bill that I lead. And we canít wait to become-"
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"Ö president to get that done, we need to get it done now."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"Well, Congressman, you just made it clear that you donít know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets. If you can develop the plan further, I think we can have a debate about it, but we canít wait. People are dying in the streets right now. We canít wait for universal background checks that we finally have a shot to actually get through. We canít wait to ban the sale of new weapons and high capacity magazines so we donít wind up with millions more of these things on the street. We canít wait for red flag laws that are going to disarm domestic abusers and prevent suicides, which are not being talked about nearly enough as a huge part of the gun violence epidemic in this country. We cannot wait for purity tests. We have to just get something done."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"The problem isnít the polls, the problem is the policy. And I donít need lessons from you on courage, political or personal. Everyone on this stage is determined to get something done. Everyone on this stage recognizes, or at least I thought we did, that the problem is not other Democrats who donít agree with your particular idea of how to handle this, the problem is the National Rifle Association and their enablers in Congress, and we should be united in taking the fight to them."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,What we owe to those survivors is to actually deliver a solution. Iím glad you offered up-
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"Ö that analogy to healthcare because this is really important. We are at the cusp of building a new American majority, to actually do things that congressmen and senators have been talking about with almost no impact for my entire-"
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"Ö adult life. No, this is really important, okay? On guns, we are this close to an assault weapons ban. That would be huge."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"Ö guns. We are this close to an assault weapons ban. That would be huge and weíre going to get wrapped around the axle in a debate over whether itís, ìHell, yes, weíre going to take your guns.î We have an opportunity to deliver-"
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"Ö healthcare to everybody, and someone on this stage was saying, ìIt doesnít count?î"
2019-10-15,Booker,"Look, I again worry about how we talk to each other and about each other and what this last week has shown. Thereís a young man in my neighborhood Ö I watched him grow up, I lived in some high rise projects with him Ö named Shahad, and he was murdered on my block last year with an assault rifle. Iím living with a sense of urgency on this problem, because when I go home to my community, like millions of Americans, we live in communities where these weapons, where these gunshots are real every single day. And I know where the American public is."
2019-10-15,Booker,"This is not about leadership. This is why when I talk about things like gun licensing and point out the differences between us, Iím not attacking people or their character or their courage on these issues. We all have courage, but itís frustrating that when the American people, 77% of Americans agree on licensing. We donít need leadership right now. We just need folks who are going to stand up and follow where the people already are, because there are millions of Americans where this is a daily nightmare, where weíre surrendering our freedoms-"
2019-10-15,Booker,"Ö to fear in this country. This is the first time in American history, this fall, where we have sent our children to school, the strongest nation on the planet Earth, and said to them, ìWe canít protect you-"
2019-10-15,Booker,Ö so in school weíre going to teach you how to hide.î There are more duck-and-cover drills and shelter-in-place drills in America now than fire drills.
2019-10-15,Booker,"If Iím President of the United States, I will bring an urgency to this issue and make sure we end the scourge of mass violence."
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,Correct.
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"I just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this. Iím looking at the Mayor of Dayton. I met one of those survivors from that shooting. 30 seconds, nine people killed. The public is with us on this in a big way. The majority of Trump voters want to see universal background checks right now. The majority of hunters want to see us move forward with gun safety legislation. There are three bills right now on Mitch McConnellís desk. The background check bill. My bill to close the boyfriend loophole so domestic abusers donít get guns. The bill to make it easier for police to vet people before they get a gun. Thatís what we should be focusing on. And I just donít want to screw this up. When Iím president, I do want to bring in an assault weapon ban and I do want to put a limitation on magazines so what happened in Dayton, Ohio will never happen again, but letís not mess this up with this fight."
2019-10-15,Warren,"Look, I want to get what workís done. I want to use the method we used, for example, with machine guns. We registered them. We put in a huge penalty if you didnít register them and a huge tax on them and let people turn them in, and it got machine guns out of the hands of people. But the problem here that we need to focus on is first how widespread gun violence is. As youíve rightly identified, itís not just about mass shootings, itís what happens in neighborhoods all across this country."
2019-10-15,Warren,"It is about suicide. It is about domestic violence. This is not going to be a one and done that we do one thing or two things or three things and then weíre done. We have to reduce gun violence overall, and the question we have to ask is why hasnít it happened? You say, weíre so close. We have been so close. I stood in the United States Senate in 2013 when 54 senators voted in favor of gun legislation-"
2019-10-15,Warren,Ö and it didnít pass because of the filibuster.
2019-10-15,Warren,Weíve got to attack the corruption and repeal the filibusters-
2019-10-15,Warren,Ö or the gun industry will always have a veto over what happens.
2019-10-15,Harris,"Five million assault weapons are on the streets of America today. During the course of this debate, eight people will die from gun violence. The leading cause of death of young black men in America is gun violence, more than the top other six reasons totaled. This is a serious matter. I have personally hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you. I have looked at more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you. I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you."
2019-10-15,Harris,"Iím done, and we need action, and Congress has had years to act and failed because they do not have the courage. When Iím elected, Iíll give them 100 days to pull their act together, put a bill on my desk for signature and if they donít, I will take executive action and put in place a comprehensive background check requirement and ban the importation of assault weapons into our country, because it is time to act."
2019-10-15,Biden,"Iím the only one on this stage who has taken on the NRA and beat them, and beat them twice. We were able to get assault weapons off the streets and not be able to be sold for 10 years. Recent studies show that mass violence went down when that occurred. The way to deal with those guns and those AR-15s and assault weapons that people own is to do what we did with the National Firearms Act as it related to machine guns. You must register that weapon. You must register it. When you register it, the likelihood of it being used diminishes exponentially. Iím the only one that moved to make sure that we could not have a magazine that had more than 10 rounds in it. Iíve done this. I know how to get it done. If you really want to get it done, go after the gun manufacturers and take back the exemption they have of not being able to be sued. That will [crosstalk 01:42:27]."
2019-10-15,Castro,"Thank you very much for the question. You know, I grew up in neighborhoods where it wasnít uncommon to hear gunshots at night, and I can remember ducking into the back seat of a car when I was a freshman in high school, across the street from my school, my public school, because folks were shooting at each other. You know, in the neighborhoods Ö Let me answer this question about voluntary versus mandatory. There are two problems I have with mandatory buybacks. Number one, folks canít define it, and if youíre not going to door door to door, then itís not really mandatory."
2019-10-15,Castro,"But also, in the places that I grew up in, we werenít exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door. And yíall saw a couple of days ago what happened to Tatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth. Cops showed up at 2:00 in the morning at her house when she was playing video games with her nephew. He didnít even announce himself, and within four seconds he shot her and killed her through her home window. She was in her own home. And so I am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in certain communities, because police violence is also gun violence and we need to address that."
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"Well, I want to thank her for this question. This is something that should never have happened to begin with. I remember when I was a prosecutor, these were not the kind of cases that were coming in our door. And itís gotten worse and worse and we now know why. As the evidence is coming out of those lawsuits, probably one of the most horrible things that I saw was the email from one of the pharma executives that actually said, ìKeep pumping them out. Theyíre eating them like Doritos.î"
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"So my first answer to that question, and which is included in my plan, is that the people that should pay for this, that should pay for the treatment, are the very people that got people hooked and killed them in the first place. And that is the people that are manufacturing these opioids. Thatís the first way. You can, with a 2 cents per milligram tax, bring in the money, plus with the federal master settlement, to help in rural areas where theyíre so isolated, and also in urban areas where itís, by the way, not just opioids, there are still meth issues and crack cocaine issues."
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"This is personal for me. My dad, he struggled with alcoholism his whole life, and by his third DWI they said to him, the prosecutor, ìYouíve got to face jail or youíve got to go to treatment.î He picked treatment and he was pursued by grace. He has been sober ever since, and now heís 91 and in assisted living. He said to me last year, ìItís hard to get a drink around here, anyway.î But he still has an AA group that visits him there. And so for me, I believe that everyone in this country, including the people in rural America, have that same right to be pursued by grace."
2019-10-15,Steyer,"Well, I think this is one of the most heartbreaking experiences that Americaís had. 72,000 people died of opioid overdoses last year, and thatís not only a tragedy for them, itís a tragedy for their family and their communities. And so I think we have to treat this as a health crisis. We have to move the resources and the support there to try and help people, but I think that Senator Klobuchar makes a good point. The reason Iím running for president is that we have a broken government, and we have a broken government because corporations have bought it."
2019-10-15,Steyer,"Every single one of these conversations is about that broken government. Itís about drug companies buying the government and getting what they want. Itís about the gun manufacturers buying the government and get what we want. We need to break the corporate stranglehold on our government. Iíve put forward actual structural changes, including term limits, a national referendum, the end to the idea that corporations are people and have the rights of American citizens politically and make it a lot easier to vote. These corporations have taken over our government, and 72,000 deaths this year are the tragic result."
2019-10-15,Yang,"Thatís exactly right, and we have to recognize this is a disease of capitalism run amuck. There was a point when there were more opiate prescriptions in the state of Ohio than human beings in the state of Ohio, and for some reason the federal government thought that was appropriate. They ended up levying a $600 million fine against Purdue Pharma, which sounds like a lot of money until you realize that company made $30 billion. They got a 2% fine and they killed tens of thousands of Americans an hour. So if the government turned a blind eye to this company spreading a plague among its people, then the least we can do is put the resources to work in our communities so our people have a fighting chance to get well. Even though this is not a money problem, we all know this is a human problem."
2019-10-15,Yang,"Part of helping people get the treatment that they need is to let them know that theyíre not going to be referred to a prison cell, they will be referred to treatment and counseling. I talked to an EMT in New Hampshire and he said he saves the same addicts over and over again, because the fact is after you save someone whoís ODing, you just bring them back to their house and they OD again the following week. So we need to decriminalize opiates for personal use. We have to let the country know this is not a personal failing, this was a systemic government failing, and then we need to open up safe consumption and safe injection sites around the country because they save lives."
2019-10-15,Harris,"I am, and I will tell you as a former prosecutor, I do think of this as being a matter of justice and accountability, because they are nothing more than some high level dope dealers. They have been engaged Ö and Iíve seen it happen before. Iíve taken on the pharmaceutical companies when I was Attorney General of California and led the second largest Department of Justice. Iíve seen what they do. The eight biggest pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies, last year profited $72 billion on the backs of people like the families that we are talking about that have been overwhelmed by this crisis, which is a public health epidemic."
2019-10-15,Harris,"And they knew what they were doing. They were marketing false advertising. They knew what they were pushing in communities and states like Ohio, without any concern about the repercussions because they were profiting and making big bucks. And yes, they should be held accountable. This is a matter of justice. And so as as President of the United States, I would ensure that the United States Department Of Justice understand that you want to deal with who is really a criminal, letís end mass incarceration and end that failed war on drugs and letís go after these pharmaceutical companies for what theyíve been doing to destroy our country in States like Ohio."
2019-10-15,Castro,"Yes, I am. They need to be held accountable, not only financially, but also criminal penalties. You know, you can draw a straight line between making sure that we hold executives accountable, whether itís these drug manufacturers or Wall Street executives that should have been held accountable a decade and a half ago."
2019-10-15,Sanders,Iím healthy. Iím feeling great. But I would like to respond to that question.
2019-10-15,Booker,"And Senator Sanders is in favor of medical marijuana. I want to make sure thatís clear, as well."
2019-10-15,Sanders,Thank you.
2019-10-15,Sanders,Iím not on it tonight. [crosstalk 01:52:17]-
2019-10-15,Sanders,"Iím more than happy to answer your question, but I wanted to pick up on what Kamala and Cory and others have said. Letís take a deep breath, take a look at this opioid epidemic. You have the executive CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies making tens of millions of dollars a year, and in this particular case with the opioids, they knew that they were selling a product to communities all over this country which were addicting people and killing them. Last year, the top 10 drug companies made $69 billion in profit. This is what unfettered capitalism is doing to this country, and itís not just the drug companies. Right now, the CEOs in the fossil fuel industry know full well that their product is destroying this world, and they continue to make huge profits."
2019-10-15,Sanders,That is why we need a political revolution-
2019-10-15,Sanders,Ö that says enough is enough to this behavior.
2019-10-15,Sanders,"Well, let me invite you all to a major rally weíre having in Queens, New York, berniesanders.com. Weíre going to have a special guest at that event and we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people. But let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes. I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and Iím so happy to be back here with you this evening."
2019-10-15,Biden,"Because Iíve watched it, I know what the job is, Iíve been engaged. Look, one of the reasons Iím running is because of my age and my experience. With it, comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track. It is required now, more than any time in any of our lifetimes, to have someone who has that capacity on day one. Thatís one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because of I know what has to be done, Iíve done it before, Iíve been there."
2019-10-15,Biden,"When we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history, Iíve been there. And Iíve got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act, as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act which kept us from going into depression. I know what has to be done. I will not need any on the job training the day I take office, and I will release my medical records, as I have 21 years of my tax records, which no one else on this stage has done, so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing."
2019-10-15,Biden,Before the first vote.
2019-10-15,Biden,Yes.
2019-10-15,Biden,"Before Iowa. I mean, look, Iíve released them before. I released 55 pages of my Ö Iím the only guy thatís released anything up here."
2019-10-15,Warren,"Well, I say I will out-work, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence, or whoever the Republicans get stuck with. Look, the way I see this, the way weíre going to win is by addressing head on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and theyíre making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind. Political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party donít want to admit that."
2019-10-15,Warren,"They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump, it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out whatís broken and we show how to fix it, Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch peopleís lives, things like childcare and healthcare and housing costs, Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight."
2019-10-15,Gabbard,"Iím glad you asked, because I was going to say itís not fair to ask these three about their health and their fitness to serve as president, but not every other one of us. I am grateful to have been trained very well by the army and do my best to stay in shape, but hereís the real question I believe you should be asking, is who is fit to serve as our commander-in-chief? This is the most important responsibility that the president has. What Donald Trump has been doing in Syria and what we have just seen with him inviting Turkey to come in and slaughter the Kurds, show what an unfit president looks like it. It highlights how critical is that we have a president and commander-in-chief whoís ready on day one, bringing experience and understanding in foreign policy and national security."
2019-10-15,Gabbard,"Bringing the experience that I have both serving in Congress now for nearly seven years, serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee, serving on the Armed Services Committee, subcommitteeís related to terrorism and upcoming threats, serving on the Homeland Security Committee. The experience that I have as a soldier, serving for over 16 years in the Army National Guard, deploying twice to the Middle East, being able to serve in different capacities, joint training exercises, training the Kuwait National Guard. I understand the importance of our national security. I am prepared to do this job to fulfill this responsibility as commander-in-chief on day one."
2019-10-15,Gabbard,"Iíd like to ask our other candidates this question, Iíd like to start with Senator Warren-"
2019-10-15,Gabbard,Ö what her experience and background is to serve as commander-in-chief?
2019-10-15,Yang,"As usual, Senator Warren is 100% right in diagnosing the problem. There are absolutely excesses in technology, and in some cases, having them divest parts of their business is the right move, but we also have to be realistic that competition doesnít solve all of the problems. Itís not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app, that would be like [inaudible 00:29:09]. Thereís a reason why no one is using Bing today. Sorry, Microsoft, itís true. So itís not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive main street businesses around the country."
2019-10-15,Yang,"And as the parent of two young children, Iím particularly concerned about screen use and its effect on our children. Studies clearly show that weíre seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use. Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier. What we have to do is we have to home in on the specific problems weíre trying to solve and use 21st century solutions for 21st century problems. Using a 20th century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new toolkit."
2019-10-15,Warren,"Look, Iím not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. Itís time to fight back. Think about it this way. When you talk about how it works in competition, about 8%, 9% of all retail sales happen in bricks and sticks stores, happen at Walmart. About 49% of all sales online happen in one place. Thatís Amazon. It collects information from every little business, and then Amazon does something else. It runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses. Look, you get to be the umpire in the baseball game or you get to have a team, but you donít get to do both at the same time. We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating big tech, big pharma, big oil, all of them."
2019-10-15,Steyer,"Look, I agree with Senator Warren that in fact monopolies have to be dealt with. They either have to be broken up or regulated, and thatís part of it, but we have to understand that Mr. Trump is going to be running on the economy. Heís going to be saying heís the person who can make it grow. I started a business from scratch, one room, no employers, and built a multi-billion dollar international business. Weíre going to have to show the American people that we donít just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies, but also talk about prosperity, talk about investing in the American people, talk about harnessing the innovation and competition of the American private sector."
2019-10-15,Steyer,"In fact, if we want to beat Mr. Trump, I think somebody who can go toe to toe with them and show them to be a fraud and a failure as a business person, and a fraud and a failure as a steward of the American economy, is going to be necessary. He is one. His tax planís a failure. His trade war is a failure. I would love to take him on as a real businessman and show-"
2019-10-15,Steyer,Ö I would love to take him on as a real businessman and show that in fact heís failed the American people and he has to go.
2019-10-15,Booker,"Anybody that does not think that we hae a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used, not just in terms of anti-competitive practices, but also to undermine our democracy. We have seen it in the í16 election practices being used that have not been corrected now. We need regulation and reform. Antitrust, I mean Robert Bork right now is laughing in his sleep. We have a reality in this country where antitrust, from pharma to farms, is causing trouble. We have to deal with this. As president of the United States I will put people in place that enforce antitrust laws."
2019-10-15,Booker,"I want to say one last thing, and I feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage, going back to the fact that we Ö Itís rich to me that we asked three people about their health when looking at this stage we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump."
2019-10-15,Sanders,"When we talk about a rigged economy itís not just the grotesque level of income in wealth and equality. It is also the fact that in sector after sector, whether it is Wall Street where you have six banks that have assets equivalent to half of the GDP of the United States; whether it is media where you have 10 media companies that control about 90% of what the American people see, hear or read; whether it is agribusiness where we see merger after merger, which is resulting in the decline of family based farming in this country, we need a president who has the guts to appoint an Attorney General who will take on these huge monopolies, protect small business, and protect consumers by ending the price fixing which we see every day."
2019-10-15,Harris,Marc. Marc.
2019-10-15,Harris,"No I donít agree with that at all. As serving on the Senate Intelligence Committee, working with Amy Klobuchar on what we need to do to upgrade the elections infrastructure, knowing that Russia needs to be held accountable for the fact that they interfered in the election of the president of the United States and will attempt to do it again, thatís a ridiculous argument heís making."
2019-10-15,Harris,But I do want to also say this. What weíre talking about is a grave injustice. When rules apply to some but not equally to all. In particular when the rules that apply to the powerless donít apply to the powerful.
2019-10-15,Harris,"Senator Warren I just want to say that I was surprised to here that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies. When I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trumpís account that you did not agree. I would urge you to join me because here we have Donald Trump who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice. He and his account should be taken down."
2019-10-15,Harris,"We saw in El Paso that that shooter, in his manifesto, was informed by how Donald Trump uses that platform. This is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shutdown that site. It is a matter of safety and corporate accountability."
2019-10-15,Warren,Look I donít just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter. I want to push him out of The White House. Thatís our job. But the way-
2019-10-15,Harris,Then join me if you donít-
2019-10-15,Warren,But the way Ö But letís figure-
2019-10-15,Harris,Join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down.
2019-10-15,Warren,No. Letís figure out-
2019-10-15,Harris,No?
2019-10-15,Warren,Ö why it is that we have had laws on the book-
2019-10-15,Harris,Wow.
2019-10-15,Warren,"Ö for antitrust for over a century. Yet for decades now weíve all called on how the big drug companies are calling the shots in Washington, Big Ag, how the gun industry, big tech. We really need to address the elephant in the room and that is how campaigns are financed."
2019-10-15,Harris,You canít say youíre for corporate-
2019-10-15,Warren,I announced this morning-
2019-10-15,Harris,Ö responsibility if it doesnít apply to everyone.
2019-10-15,Warren,"I announced this morning that Iím not going to take any money from big tech executives, from Wall Street executives. Weíve already agreed Bernie and I, weíre not taking any money from big pharma executives. You canít go behind closed doors, and take the money of these executives, and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws. We need campaign finance rules and practices-"
2019-10-15,Warren,[crosstalk 02:14:24] Ö that support us all.
2019-10-15,Harris,"It does not represent a system of justice to say that the rules will apply differently to different people. This is a matter, you are saying, of holding big tech accountable."
2019-10-15,Warren,Yes.
2019-10-15,Harris,"Holding big tech accountable because they have an out-sized influence on peopleís perceptions about issues. They actually influence behaviors. We all have to agree this is their power, it is immense."
2019-10-15,Harris,[crosstalk 02:14:55] Iím not finished. [crosstalk 02:14:57] Iím not finished. What I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook.
2019-10-15,Warren,Look I think all of the rules should apply across the board. I donít have a problem with that.
2019-10-15,Harris,So you will join me in saying-
2019-10-15,Warren,What I do have a problem with-
2019-10-15,Harris,Ö Twitter should shutdown that account?
2019-10-15,Warren,"Ö is that if weíre going to talk seriously about breaking up big tech then we should ask if people are taking money from the big tech executives. I weíre going to talk seriously about breaking up big drug companies we should ask if people are financing their campaigns by taking money from big drug executives. If we are going to talk about Wall Street, and having some serious regulation over Wall Street, we should ask if people are funding their campaigns by taking money from those executives."
2019-10-15,Warren,So long as thatís-
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"[crosstalk 02:15:49] I would like to have a different take on this. I was in the private sector for 14 years. Represented companies that were fighting to get into the telecom market. I had a life before government. What I saw was when we got more competition there the prices went down in a big way, in the long-distance market."
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"Well right now we have another gilded age going on. I am the lead Democrat on the Antitrust Committee. I have the lead legislation, which means, one, changing the standard so we can do a better job of doing just what weíve been talking about here, is breaking down some of this consolidation. Also making sure that the enforcers have the resources to take them on because theyíre so overwhelmed. But the issue here is this, start talking about this as a pro competition issue. This used to be a Republican and Democratic issue because America, our founding fathers, actually wanted to have less consolidation. We were a place of entrepreneurship. We are seeing a startup slump in this country-"
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,Ö and this means-
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,Ö everything from tech on down.
2019-10-15,Castro,"Yeah. I think that weíre on the right track, in terms of updating how we look at monopolistic practices. Setting, as Congressman OíRourke said, rules for the road that match the challenges that we face today. Whether thatís Amazon that is leveraging its size, I think, to help put small businesses out of business. Then at the same time shortchanging a lot of its workers. Not paying them as they should, not giving them the benefits that they should. Or itís a number of other companies, big tech companies. We need to take a stronger stance when it comes to cracking down on monopolistic trade practices. Thatís what I would do as president."
2019-10-15,Yang,"[crosstalk 02:17:32] Thatís the way we can fight back. [crosstalk 02:17:34] The best way we can fight back against big tech companies is to say our data is our property. Right now our data is worth more than oil. How many of you remember getting your data check in the mail? It got lost. It went to Facebook, Amazon, Google. If we say this is our property and we share in the gains thatís the best way we can balance the scales against the big tech companies."
2019-10-15,Harris,Thereís a bigger issue here.
2019-10-15,Harris,"My plan is as follows, for any state that passes a law that violates the Constitution, and in particular Roe v. Wade, our Department of Justice will review that law to determine if it is compliant with Roe v. Wade and the Constitution. If it is not that law will not go into affect. Thatís called pre-clearance."
2019-10-15,Harris,"Because the reality is that while we still have, as I said earlier, these state legislators who are outdated and out of touch, mostly men who are telling women what to do with their bodies, then there needs to be accountability and consequence."
2019-10-15,Harris,"But Iíll go further. You may have seen I questioned Brett Kavanaugh when I was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Asked him, as a nominee to serve on the United States Supreme Court, could he think of any law that tells a man what to do with his body? The answer was, ìUh, uh, no.î The reality of it is this is still a fundamental issue of justice for women in America. Women have been given the responsibility to perpetuate the human species. Our bodies were created to do that. It does not give any other person the right to tell a woman what to do with that body. It is her body, it is her right, it is her decision."
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"I would codify Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the land. But what I want to do right now is just say what if Donald Trump was standing up here on the debate stage with me? You know what I would say to him? Iíd say, ìYou know you said you wanted to do this. In your race for president you actually said that you wanted to put women in jail. Then you tried to dial it back and you said you wanted to put doctors in jail. That is exactly what the Alabama law is. It put doctors in jail for 99 years. You Donald Trump are not on the side of women. You are not on the side of people of this country when over 75% of people want to keep Roe v. Wade on the book. When over 90% of people want to make sure we have available contraception. You defunded Planned Parenthood. I would fund it again.î"
2019-10-15,Booker,"Well first of all letís be clear about these laws we see from Alabama to Ohio, theyíre not just a tax on one of the most sacrosanct ideals in our country liberty, the ability to control your own body, but they are particular another example of people trying to punish, trying to penalize, trying to criminalize poverty. Because this is disproportionately affecting low income women in this country, people in rural areas in this country. It is an assault on the most fundamental ideal, that human beings should control their own body."
2019-10-15,Booker,"The way, as president of the United States, Iím going to deal with this is first of all elevating it like we have with other national crises to a White House level position. I will create the Office of Reproductive Freedom and Reproductive Rights in The White House. Make sure that we begin to fight back on a systematic attempt, thatís gone on for decades, to undermine Roe v. Wade. I will fight to codify it. I will also make sure that we fight, as this country, to repeal the Hyde Amendment so that we are leading the planet Earth in defending the global-"
2019-10-15,Booker,Ö assault we see on women right now.
2019-10-15,Gabbard,"This is often one of the most difficult decisions that a woman will ever have to make. Itís unfortunate to see how, in this country, it has for so long been used as a divisive political weapon. I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare I think sheís correct. We see how the consequences of laws that youíre referring to can often lead to a dangerous place. As weíve seen them, as theyíre passed in other countries, where a woman who has a miscarriage passed that six weeks could be imprisoned because abortion would be illegal at that point."
2019-10-15,Gabbard,I do however think that there should be some restrictions in place. I support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that during the third trimester abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.
2019-10-15,Biden,"I would not get in a Court [pecking 02:23:13]. We had three justices, next time around we lose control they had three justices. We began to lose any credibility the Court has at all."
2019-10-15,Biden,"I want to point out that the justices Iíve supported Ö When I defeated Robert Bork and I say when I defeated Robert Bork I made sure we guaranteed a womanís right to chose for a better part of a generation. I would make sure that we move and insist that we codify Roe v. Wade. The public is already there. Things have changed. I would go out and I would campaign against those people in the state of Ohio, Alabama, et cetera, who in fact are throwing up this barrier. Reproductive rights are a constitutional right. In fact every woman should have that right. I would not pack the Court. What I would do is make sure that the people that I recommended for the Court, from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Elena Kagan, who used to work for me, to others, that they in fact support the right of privacy. On which the entire notion of a womanís right to choose is based. Thatís what I would do. No one would get on the Court Ö"
2019-10-15,Biden,"By the way, if in fact at the end of this Ö The beginning of next year, if in fact one of the justices steps down, God forbid, in fact I would make sure that we would do exactly what McConnell did last time out. We would not allow any hearing to be held for a new justice."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"Thatís right. When I proposed reforming the Supreme Court some folks said that was too bold to even contemplate. Now Iím not talking about packing the Court just with people who agree with me, although I certainly will appoint people who share my values. For example the idea that womenís reproductive freedom is an American right. What Iím talking about is reforms that will depoliticize the Court. We canít go on like this, where every single time there is a vacancy we have this apocalyptic ideological firefight over what to do next."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"Now one way to fix this would be to have a 15 member Court where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other 10. Smarter legal minds than mine are discussing this in the Yale Law Journal on how this could be done without a constitutional amendment. But the point is that not everybody arrives on a partisan basis. There are other reforms that we could consider. From term limits, donít forget justices used to just retire like everybody else, to a rotation off the appellate bench."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,Iím not wedded to a particular solution but I am committed to establishing a commission on day one-
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,Ö that will propose reforms to depoliticize the Supreme Court because we canít go on like this.
2019-10-15,Castro,"I donít think it is. I wouldnít pack the Court. I think the plan that Mayor Pete mentioned is an interesting one, but I actually believe if we were selecting from one of those things that the smarter move might be to look at term limits or having people cycle off from the appellate courts. So that you would have a replenishment of perspective."
2019-10-15,Castro,"I would also make sure that I appoint, as president, people who respect the precedent of Roe v. Wade. That we codify Roe v. Wade. That we do away with things like the Hyde Amendment because you shouldnít only be able to have reproductive freedom if you have money. We have to think about people who do not, people who are poor. We have to concern ourselves not only with reproductive freedom but also reproductive justice. Invest in the ability of every woman to be able to make a choice and to be able to have her healthcare needs met."
2019-10-15,Warren,"I think there are a number of options. I think as Mayor Buttigieg said there are many different ways. People are talking about different options. I think we may have to talk about them. But on Roe versus Wade can we just pause for a minute here. I lived in an America where abortion was illegal. Rich women still got abortions because they could travel, they could go to places where it was legal. What weíre talking about now is that the people who are denied access to abortion are the poor, are the young, are 14 year olds who were molested by a family member. We now have support across this country. Three out of four Americans believe in the rule of Roe versus Wade. When youíve got three out of four Americans supporting it we should be able to get that passed through Congress."
2019-10-15,Warren,We should not leave this to the Supreme Court we should do it through democracy because we can.
2019-10-15,Biden,"Well I think there vision is attracting a lot of people. I think a lot of what they have to say is really important. But as Senator Warren said, ìWe canít be running any vague campaigns.î We got to level with people. Weíve got to level with people and tell them exactly what weíre going to do, how weíre going to get it done. If you can get it done."
2019-10-15,Biden,"Iím going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here but Iím the only one on this stage thatís gotten anything really big done. From the Violence Against Women Act, to making sure that we passed the Affordable Care Act, to be in a position where we in fact took almost a 90 billion dollar act that kept us from going into a depression, putting us in a position where I was able to end Roe Ö Excuse me, able to end the issue of gun sales, in terms of assault weapons. The question is who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is whoís going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done?"
2019-10-15,Biden,"Iím not suggesting they canít but Iím suggesting that thatís what we should look at. Part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what itís going to cost, how youíre going to do it, and why youíre going to do it. Thatís the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade."
2019-10-15,Biden,"Well the senator said Ö Sheís being vague on the issue of Ö Actually both of them are being vague on the issue of the Medicare for all. Now look, hereís the deal, come on it costs 30 trillion dollars. Guess what? Thatís over three trillion dollars a year. Itís part of the entire budget. Let me finish, okay?"
2019-10-15,Biden,"If you eliminated the entire Pentagon, every single thing. Planes, ship, troop, the building, everything, satellites, it would get you and pay for a total of four months. Four months. Where do you get the rest? Whereís it come from?"
2019-10-15,Sanders,Two things. Let me respond-
2019-10-15,Sanders,"Ö in two ways. Joe you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? I say this as a good friend. You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill which is hurting middle class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR, with China done which have cost us four million jobs."
2019-10-15,Sanders,"Now letís get to Medicare for all. Letís be honest. We spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on Earth. The answer is if we have the guts that I would like to see the Democratic have that guts, to stand up to the drug companies, and the insurance companies, and tell them that the function of healthcare is the guaranteed care to all people. Not to make 100 billion dollars in profit."
2019-10-15,Sanders,If we stood together we could create the greatest healthcare system in the world.
2019-10-15,Biden,We can do that without Medicare for all. We can do that by adding a [crosstalk 02:31:22] public option. We can.
2019-10-15,Sanders,No you canít.
2019-10-15,Biden,We can afford to do it. We can afford-
2019-10-15,Sanders,Youíve got to take on the greed and the profiteering of the-
2019-10-15,Biden,By the way-
2019-10-15,Sanders,Ö healthcare industry.
2019-10-15,Biden,Ö the greed and the profiteering-
2019-10-15,Biden,Let me finish.
2019-10-15,Biden,"The greed and profiteering of those insurance companies, they are as much against my bill as they are anybody elseís. They were strongly against Obamacare. They know it cost them. Itís going to take away the right of people to choose. The 160 million people out there whoíve negotiated their health insurance and they want to keep it. They should have a right to keep it."
2019-10-15,Warren,"You started this question with how you got something done. Following the financial crash of 2008 I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. All of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, ìDonít even try because you will never get it passed.î Sure enough the big banks fought us, the Republicans fought us, some of the Democrats fought us, but we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than 12 billion dollars directly to people they cheated."
2019-10-15,Warren,"I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority and I will use it. In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill which will beat back the influence of money-"
2019-10-15,Warren,Ö and repeal the filibuster. The third we want to get something done in America we have to get out there-
2019-10-15,Warren,Ö and fight for the things that touch peopleís lives.
2019-10-15,Biden,I agreed with Ö Let me Ö She referenced me.
2019-10-15,Biden,"I agreed with the great job she did. I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people for it, so letís get those things straight too."
2019-10-15,Warren,"I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law. I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law, but understand-"
2019-10-15,Biden,You did a hell of a job in your job.
2019-10-15,Warren,"Thank you. But understand this it was a dream big, fight hard. People told me, ìGo for something little. Go for something small. Go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept.î"
2019-10-15,Warren,"I said, ìNo. Letís go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy.î"
2019-10-15,Warren,"President Obama said, ìI will fight for that.î He sometimes-"
2019-10-15,Warren,Ö had to fight against people in his own administration. We have to-
2019-10-15,Biden,Not me.
2019-10-15,Warren,Ö be willing to make good-
2019-10-15,Warren,Ö big structural change.
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,If I had a buck for every argument that Iíve witnessed like this I could pay for college for everybody. We need to move passed what has been consuming this whole political space for as long as Iíve been alive.
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"Weíre being offered a false choice. I donít agree with the Vice President that Trump is an aberration. I donít agree that thereís any such thing as back to normal because here in the industrial Midwest, definitely where I live, normal didnít work. Thatís part of how we got here. Thatís part of how a guy like Donald Trump managed to get within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"But I also donít agree with Senator Warren that the only way forward is infinite partisan combat. Yes we have to fight. Absolutely we have to fight for the big changes at hand, but itís going to take more than fighting."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"Once again I want to take you back to that day after Trump has stopped being president. Think about what the president can do to unify a new American majority for some of the boldest things weíve attempted in my lifetime. Medicare for all who want it, actually getting something done on immigration for the first time since the í80s, an assault weapons ban which would be a huge deal, making college free for low and middle income students. Yet there are some here on this stage who say it doesnít count unless we go even further. Free college for low and middle income students isnít good enough unless weíre also paying for the children of billionaires. Immigration reform isnít enough unless we also decriminalize border crossings."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,We have an opportunity to do the biggest things-
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,Ö weíve done in my lifetime.
2019-10-15,Biden,[crosstalk 02:35:43] I did not say back to normal.
2019-10-15,Warren,[crosstalk 02:35:45] Ö he called me out by name.
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,Thank you.
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"This isnít a fly over part of the country to me. The heartland is where I live. I want to win those states that we lost last time. I have bold ideas to get us there. I think just because theyíre different than Elizabethís doesnít mean theyíre bold. But we canít get any of this done, on climate change or immigration reform, unless they win."
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"What I have done is win. The only one up here time and time again the reddest of red districts. Michele Bachmannís, I won that district three times. Rural districts that border Iowa and North, and South, Dakota. I do it by going not just where itís comfortable but where itís uncomfortable. That is why I have been in Pennsylvania, and in Michigan, and in Wisconsin, and all over Ohio, and in Iowa. Because I think we need to build a blue Democratic wall around those states and-"
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,Ö make Donald Trump pay for it.
2019-10-15,Warren,"People who are struggling to pay healthcare are fighting today. People who are getting crushed by student loans are in a fight today. People who are getting stopped by the police, or paid less because of the color of their skin, are in a fight today. Anyone who doesnít understand that Americans are already in these fights is not someone whoís likely to win them. For me this is about knowing whatís broken, knowing how to fix it. Yes Iím willing to get out there and fight for it."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,But thereís a missing piece-
2019-10-15,Sanders,Iíll tell you why.
2019-10-15,Sanders,"[crosstalk 02:37:26] Hereís the radical reason why, itís what the American people want."
2019-10-15,Warren,Yes.
2019-10-15,Sanders,"All right? The American people do not want tax breaks for billionaires. They want the rich to start paying their fair share of taxes. Poll came out yesterday, 71% of Democrats support Medicare for all. The people of this country understand that we got to make public colleges and universities tuition free. More and more Americans, including Republicans, understand we need bold action if weíre going to save this planet for our children and our grandchildren. The way you win an election, in this time in history, is not the same old same old. You have to inspire people, you have to excite people. You got to bring working people, and young people, and poor people into-"
2019-10-15,Sanders,Ö the political process.
2019-10-15,Sanders,Because they know you stand for them not corporate America.
2019-10-15,Castro,"Well, first of all, thank you to Mark, thank you Anderson, and thank you Aaron and CNN and New York Times and everybody whoís here tonight. Some of the most interesting friendships that Iíve had have been with people different from me. Either people older than me that had a lot to teach me or people who grew up very different from me. Also, teachers as I was growing up, people that had a life experience that when I was growing up was beyond mine. And sometimes also, and this goes to the heart of your question, I think people who thought differently from me. Folks that I considered and have considered friends, and I think that thereís a value to that. I think that that should be reflected more in our public life. I also believe to just speak about the incident last week with Ellen and George W. Bush, I completely understood what she was saying about being kind to others."
2019-10-15,Castro,"I believe that we should be more kind to other folks. I also believe that we should hold people to account for what theyíve done, especially public servants who have a record of having done something or not done something, and I think that we can do both of those things. I think that we can kind to people and also hold them accountable for their actions and their people, whether itís our former president, George W. Bush or others that should be held accountable just as we should be kind. We shouldnít be made to feel shameful about holding people accountable for what theyíve done."
2019-10-15,Gabbard,"Thank. You know where I come from in Hawaii. Many of you know, we greet each other with Aloha. Itís not a word that means hello and goodbye. It actually means something much more powerful than that. It means I come to you with respect and a recognition that we are all connected. We are all brothers and sisters, we are all Godís children. So Iíve developed friendships that some people may be surprised about within the Washington circles, especially with Republicans like Trey Gowdy, for example. He and I disagree a lot and very strongly on a lot of political issues. Weíve developed a friendship thatís based on respect and heís been there for me during some personally challenging times. The challenge before us today is that our country is very divided. Donald Trump must be defeated. But we must do more than just defeat Donald Trump. We need to deliver a win for the American people."
2019-10-15,Gabbard,"We must stand United as Americans remembering that we are all brothers and sisters, that we are all connected. This is the kind of leadership that I seek to bring as president. Inspired by the example of presidents like Abraham Lincoln who talked about how we should have malice for none and charity for all. When I look out at our country, I donít see deplorables, I see fellow Americans. People who I treat with respect even when we disagree and when we disagree strongly. I will work to restore a White House that represents light and compassion and respect for every American regardless of race, religion, orientation, gender or political affiliation. So I want to ask everyone to join me. Join me in bringing about this government of by and for the people that serves all the people of this country and visit my website, tulsi2020.com for more information."
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"For me, itís John McCain and I miss him every day. I traveled all over the world with him and he would sometimes when we were seated with world leaders and they would look away from me, heíd say, ìSenator Klobuchar is a lead Democrat on this trip and she will go next.î And I still remember being there at his ranch. John and I went to visit him and Cindy when he was dying and he pointed to some words in his book because he could hardly talk. And the word said this, there is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself. Thatís what weíre doing right now. And while we have had major debates about policy, we have to remember that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. And we have to remember that our job is to not just change policy, but to change the tone in our politics, to look up from our phones, to look at each other, to start talking to each other because the way we win and not just win the presidency, but take back the US Senate is by winning big."
2019-10-15,Klobuchar,"And the way we win big is with that fired up Democratic base thatís out there today, but it is also about bringing in independence and moderate Republicans. I can lead this and I asked you to join me because Iíve done it before and I will do it again, amyklobuchar.com. Join our team. Thank you."
2019-10-15,Steyer,"Iím friends with a woman from Denmark, South Carolina, MD, Ana Berry whoís fighting for clean water and environmental justice in her community. Sheís a different gender, sheís a different race, sheís from a different part of the country. But she reminds me of my parents in terms of her courage and her optimism. And her honor, my mother was a school teacher in the New York public schools and in the Brooklyn House of Detention. My father was the first generation in his family to go to college. My grandfather was a plumber. He interrupted his law degree to go into the Navy in World War II and he ended up prosecuting the Nazis at Nuremberg. And when I asked him what that experience meant, he said, ìWhen you see something wrong in your society, you fight it from the first day and every single day after.î And thatís why I started the need to impeach movement two years ago, because there was something terribly wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."
2019-10-15,Steyer,"And over 10 years ago, I saw that there was a terrible threat to the safety and health of every American in terms of the climate crisis, and Iíve been fighting those companies with the help of the American people ever since successfully and thatís why Iím running for president because our government has failed. Itís been taught by corporations and itís absolutely essential to return power to the people. I have been doing exactly what my parents taught me to do, which is to take on the biggest problems in America directly and fight for them every single day."
2019-10-15,Booker,"Well, look, I have so many, I donít even know where to count. I was the mayor of a large city with a Republican governor, he and I had to form a friendship even though I can write a dissertation on our disagreements. When I got to the United States Senate, I went there with a purpose of making friendships across the aisle. I go to Bible study and chairman in Hoffís office. He and I passed legislation together to help homeless and foster kids. I went out to try to invite every one of my Republican colleagues to dinner and let me again say, finding a dinner in a restaurant, agreeing on one with Ted Cruz was a very difficult thing. Iím a vegan and heís a meat eating Texan, but Iíll tell you this right now, this is the moment in America that this is our test, the spirit of our country, I believe in the values of rugged individualism and self-reliance, but think about our history."
2019-10-15,Booker,"Rugged individualism didnít get us to the moon. It didnít beat the Nazis. It didnít map the human genome. It didnít beat Jim Crow. Everything we did in this country, big and vice president, we have done so many big things. The fact that thereís an openly gay man now, black woman, all of us on the stage or because we in the past are all inheritors of a legacy of common struggle and common purpose. This election is not a referendum on one guy in one office, itís a referendum on who we are and who we must be to each other. The next leader is going to have to be one amongst us Democrats that can unite us all, not throw elbows at other Democrats that are unfair because the preparation is being the leader that can revive civic grace in our country. Teach us a more courageous empathy and remind America that patriotism is love of country and you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow country men and women and love is not sentimentality, itís not anemic. Love is struggle."
2019-10-15,Booker,"Love is sacrifice. Love is the words of our founders who said at the end of the declaration of independence that if weíre ever going to make it as a nation, we must mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor. I am running for president to restore that sacred honor and if you believe in not like I do, please join me by going to corybooker.com. Thank you."
2019-10-15,Yang,"First I want to thank all the voters tuned in at home. If you donít feel like you got your question answered tonight, itís understandable, there are 12 of us. Iím going to be answering voter questions for 10 straight hours Friday. My website, yang2020.com and if you ask your question tonight, thereís a better chance Iíll get to it. My surprising friendship, itís been so much fun running for president because Iíve gotten to meet so many Americans I never would have gotten to meet otherwise. The friendship that sticks out for me guy named Fred, whoís an avid Trump supporter, a trucker. He let me ride in his truck for hours. He spent some time in jail. I heard about his experiences trying to get other people off of drugs. And Iím happy to say that after our ride together, he actually said that he would move from Donald Trump to my campaign, which was a thrill for me. And weíve remained in touch ever since."
2019-10-15,Yang,"The truth is that what happened to the 4 million manufacturing workers here in Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Iowa did not care about our political party. The fourth industrial revolution is now migrating from manufacturing workers to retail, call centers, transportation, as well as to white collar workers like attorneys, pharmacists, and radiologists. It does not care about our party. Donald Trump had a set of solutions in 2016 and what did he say? He said, weíre going to build a wall. Weíre going to turn the clock back. Weíre going to bring the old jobs back. America, we have to do the opposite of all of these things. We have to turn the clock forward. We have to accelerate our economy and society as quickly as possible. We have to evolve in the way we think about ourselves and our work and our value. It is not left, it is not right, it is forward and that is where we must take the country in 2020."
2019-10-15,Harris,"Thank you. Probably Paul Ryan. Actually, I invited him to join me on a bill to end the money bail system in the United States. He and I agree on almost nothing, but we agreed on that. And after we joined forces, he said to me, ìKamila, you know, Appalachia loves this. And it really made the point that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And I guess thatís why Iím running. I do believe that to beat Donald Trump, but also to heal our country. We need a leader who has the ability to unify our country and see that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And Iíll tell you, my mother was 19 when she left India alone and she wanted to travel to learn science because her mission in life was to cure cancer."
2019-10-15,Harris,"And so she arrived in California, she was supposed to have an arranged marriage, but she got involved in the civil rights movement. She met my father and that produced my sister and me. They got married. But when I was five, that marriage ended. But my mother convinced us that we could do anything. And so I became the first woman attorney, general California. The second black woman elected to the United States Senate. And I will tell you, thatís part of why Iím running, because Donald Trump, if he had his way, my story would not be possible. And I am running to make sure that that dream, the American dream, American values, American ideals will always hold true. And so thatís what is at stake in this election and I believe I am uniquely able to see the commonalities among us and to speak the story of the American dream and the need to reclaim it."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"Well, I think about the friendships that I formed in the military. People who were radically different from me, different generation, different race, definitely different politics and we learned to trust each other with our lives. When they got into my vehicle, and when we went outside the wire, they didnít care if I was going home to a boyfriend or a girlfriend. They didnít care what country my dad immigrated from and whether he was documented or not. We just learned to trust each other. In fact, the fact that I want every American to have that experience without having to go to war to get there is one of the reasons why I believe national service is so important. I guess Iíll follow in the pattern tonight and point out you could go to peteforamerica.com and read all about it."
2019-10-15,Buttigieg,"Itís also about building a sense of belonging in this country because I think thatís what friendship and thatís what service can create and I think we have a crisis of belonging in this country that is helping to explain so many of our problems from our politics being what it is to the fact that people are self-medicating and weíre seeing a rise in the deaths from despair. I believe only the president can build a sense of belonging and purpose for the entire country. The purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president. It is the unification of the American people and Iím asking for your vote to be that president when the dust clears over the rubble of our norms and institutions at the end of the Trump presidency, pick up the pieces and guide us toward a better future."
2019-10-15,Sanders,"When I was chairman of the Senate Committee on veterans affairs, I tried to get through the most comprehensive piece of veterans legislation in modern American history and I failed. I only had two Republicans to vote with me in the Senate, so we had to go back to the drawing board. And I worked with John McCain and I certainly did not get in that legislation working with McCain all that I wanted, but it turned out that we were able to pass a very, very significant piece of legislation, including $5 billion more for the veterans administration. More recently, I worked with a very conservative Republican from Utah, mike Lee. And Mike understood, although he and I disagree on everything, that the US involvement in the Saudi led war in Yemen was a catastrophic disaster for the people of Yemen. And for the first time in 45 years, we were able to get the War Powers Act utilized and get the votes to get the US troops out of that area."
2019-10-15,Sanders,"But I think at the end of the day what I appreciate is that we have got to end the hatred that Trump is fostering on our people, the divisiveness, trying to divide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born or our sexual orientation or our religion, and there is no job that I would undertake with more passion than bringing our people together around an agenda that works for every man, woman, and child in this country rather than the corporate elite and the 1%. A progressive agenda that stands for all is the way that we transform this country."
2019-10-15,Warren,"You asked about a surprising friend. For me, it would be Charles Fried. 27 years ago when I was under consideration for a job, he was someone who had been George Bush, the first solicitor general, a deeply principled Republican. And we didnít agree on much. I was far more liberal than he was, but he also was willing to listen to my work about whatís happening to Americaís middle class. And Charles engaged with it over and over and ultimately is the person who made sure I got the job. I grew up out in Oklahoma, I have three older brothers. They all served in the military. Two of the three are still Republicans. I love all three of my brothers and there are a lot of things that weíre divided on there are core things that we believe in together. We want to see all of our children get a good start in life."
2019-10-15,Warren,"We donít want to see any of our friends or neighbors not get covered by healthcare. Weíre willing to get out there for the things we believe in. Look, people across this country, whether theyíre Democrats, independents, or Republicans, they know whatís broken. They know that we have an America thatís working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner and thinner slice at the top and leaving everyone else behind. People across this country, regardless of party, are ready to say no more. We want an America that works for everyone. 2020 is our moment in history. It is a deep honor to be here, to be in this fight. I know whatís broken, I know how to fix it and we are building a grassroots movement to get it done. That includes everyone."
2019-10-15,Biden,"This is reassuring in the fact that weíre all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle, get things done. No other way to get anything done in this country. The two people maybe that surprised you the most were, heís been mentioned twice, but John McCain. John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy and he was assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends, became very close friends with my wife, Jill. Visited our home. He was there with his children and on his deathbed, he asked me to do his eulogy. I would say to John, ìJohn, you didnít see a war. You never wanted a fight.î And heíd say, ìYou didnít see a problem. Youíd never wanted to solve.î But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable, he was honorable."
2019-10-15,Biden,"And one of the things, thatís the reason why Iím running, we have to restore the soul of this country. Thatís why Iím doing this. In fact, this president has ripped the soul out of this country, divided us in ways that are absolutely outrageous, a liar. He cheats. He does not do anything to promote people generally. Secondly, we have to rebuild the middle class and the only weíre going to do that is to be able to reach across the aisle. My dad used to say, ìA jobís about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey. Itís about your dignity.î We have to restore peopleís dignity. And lastly, we have to unite the country because folks, itís time we stop walking around with our heads down. We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the 21st century."
2019-10-15,Biden,"So for Godís sake, get up, get up, and remember, this is the United States of America. Thereís nothing, nothing weíre unable to do when we decide weíre going to do it. Nothing at all, period."
2019-09-12,Biden,I will be a president for every American.
2019-09-12,Warren,This is our moment.
2019-09-12,Sanders,We are in a struggle for the future of this country.
2019-09-12,Harris,We fight for our country. Thatís the nature of who we are.
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"Right now, we can act."
2019-09-12,Yang,Weíre in the midst of the greatest economic transformation.
2019-09-12,Booker,We have overcome worse times and darker moments than this.
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,We are on a march together.
2019-09-12,Castro,Weíre going to win by being bold. Weíre going to win by being fearless.
2019-09-12,Castro,"Good evening. [Spanish 00:03:35]. Welcome to Texas. Itís great to be here at TSU, home of the Tigers. You know, on January 20th, 2021, at 12:01 PM, weíre going to have a Democratic president, a Democratic House, and a Democratic Senate. There will be life after Donald Trump. The truth is that our problems didnít start just with Donald Trump, and we wonít solve them by embracing old ideas. We need a bold vision. Universal pre-K and universal health care. Unleashing millions of new jobs in the clean energy economy. A tax system that rewards people who have to work for a living."
2019-09-12,Castro,"First, we have to win, and that means exciting a young, diverse coalition of Americans who are ready for a bold future. Thatís what Kennedy did. Itís what Carter did. Itís what Clinton did. Itís what Barack Obama did, and itís what I can do in this race. Get back Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Florida, Georgia, and Arizona, and finally turn Texas blue, and say goodbye to Donald Trump."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"Good evening, Texas Southern. I believe that what unites us up here, the ten of us, is much stronger than what divides us, and I think thatís true of our country, too. Now, I may not be the loudest person up here, but I think weíve already got that in the White House. Houston, we have a problem. We have a guy there that is literally running our country like a game show. He would rather lie than lead. I think we need something different. I am someone that tells the truth. I donít make promises that I canít keep. I have peopleís back, and I believe that to win, you bring people with you, and that is how you govern, as well. Youíre going to hear a lot of ideas up here. Some will be great, but if you see that some of them seem a little off track, Iíve got a better way. If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics, and you are tired of the noise and the nonsense, youíve got a home with me. Because I donít want to be the president for half of America. I want to be the president for all of America."
2019-09-12,Booker,"It was over twenty years ago that I was a law student, and moved to inner city Newark, New Jersey, to serve as a tenantsí rights lawyer, to try to address the challenges in my community. I was sobered by them. The gun violence, the substandard housing, but it was my greatest mentor, a woman named Ms. Virginia Jones, who challenged me. She said, ìBoy, if all you see in this neighborhood is problems, thatís all thereís ever going to be, but if youíre stubborn, and defiant, and can put forth a vision that can unify people, then we can make transformative change.î She was a church woman that said, ìWithout vision, the people will perish.î"
2019-09-12,Booker,"Well, thatís exactly what we did. We created extraordinary unity in our community, and we did things that other people thought were impossible. Thatís the story of America. At our best, we unify. We find common cause and common purpose. The differences amongst us Democrats on the stage are not as great as the urgency for us to unite as a party. Not just to beat Donald Trump, but to unite America in common cause and common purpose. Thatís why Iím running for president, and thatís how I will lead this nation."
2019-09-12,Yang,"In America today, everything revolves around the almighty dollar. Our schools, our hospitals, our media, even our government. Itís why we donít trust our institutions anymore. We have to get our country working for us again, instead of the other way around. We have to see ourselves as the owners and shareholders of this democracy, rather than inputs into a giant machine."
2019-09-12,Yang,"When you donate money to a presidential campaign, what happens? The politician spends the money on TV ads and consultants, and you hope it works out. Itís time to trust ourselves more than our politicians. Thatís why Iím going to do something unprecedented tonight. My campaign will now give a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families. Someone watching this at home right now. If you believe that you can solve your own problems better than any politician, go to yang2020.com and tell us how $1,000 a month will help you do just that. This is how we will get our country working for us again, the American people."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"Itís original. Iíll give you that. The American people are divided and doubtful at the very moment we need to rise to some of the greatest challenges weíve ever seen. As a mayor of an industrial city coming back from the brink, as a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, I know whatís at stake in our national leadership. We keep sending politicians to Washington, asking them to fight for us, but then when they get there, they seem more interested in the part about fighting than the part about us. Good politics is supposed to be not about the day to day fights of the politicians, but about the day to day lives of Americans."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"We just marked the anniversary of 9-11. All day today, Iíve been thinking about September 12th. The way it felt when, for a moment, we came together as a country. Imagine if we had been able to sustain that unity. Imagine what would be possible right now with ideas that are bold enough to meet the challenges of our time, but big enough, as well, that they could unify the American people. Thatís what presidential leadership can do. Thatís what the Presidency is for, and that is why Iím asking for your vote."
2019-09-12,Harris,"Thank you. Itís great to be back at TSU. I plan on spending tonight talking with you about my plans to address the problems that keep you up at night. First, I have a few words for Donald Trump, who we all know is watching. President Trump, you spent the last two and a half years full time trying to sow hate and division among us, and that is why weíve gotten nothing done. You have used hate, intimidation, fear, and over 12,000 lies as a way to distract from your failed policies and your broken promises. The only reason youíve not been indicted is because there was a memo in the Department of Justice that says the sitting president cannot be charged with a crime. Hereís what you donít get. What you donít get is that the American people are so much better than this. We know that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us, regardless of our race, where we live, or the party with which weíre registered to vote. I plan on focusing on our common issues, our common hopes and desires, and in that way, unifying our country, winning this election, and turning the page for America. Now President Trump, you can go back to watching Fox News."
2019-09-12,Sanders,"Let me be blunt and tell you what you donít hear much about in Congress, or in the media, and that is it goes without saying that we must and will defeat Trump, the most dangerous president in the history of this country. We must do more. We must do more. We have got to recognize that this country is moving into an oligarchic form of society, where a handful of billionaires control the economic and political life of this country. As president, I am prepared to take them on. Yes, we will raise the minimum wage to a living wage. Yes, we will finally make sure that every American has healthcare as a human right, not a privilege. Yes, we will address the catastrophic crisis of climate change, and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel."
2019-09-12,Warren,"I was born and raised in Oklahoma, but Iím sure glad to be in Texas tonight. All three of my brothers served in military bases here in Texas. That was their ticket to the middle class. Me, I got my big opportunity about a half a mile down the road from here, at the University of Houston, back when it cost $ 50 a semester. For a price that I could pay for on a part time waitressing job, I got to finish my four year degree, and I became a special needs teacher. After law school, my first big job was back here in Houston. By then, I had two little kids, and when childcare nearly brought me down, my Aunt [Bea 00:14:53] moved in and saved us all. The paths to Americaís middle class have gotten a lot smaller and a lot narrower. Today, service members are preyed upon by predatory lenders. Students are crushed by debt and families cannot afford childcare. I know whatís broken. I know how to fix it, and Iím going to lead the fight to get it done."
2019-09-12,Biden,"You know, when President Kennedy announced the moon shot, he used a phrase that sticks with me my whole life. He said, ìWeíre doing it because we refused to postpone.î Well, I refuse to postpone one more minute spending billions of dollars on curing cancer, Alzheimerís, and other diseases, which if we invest in them, we can find cures. I refuse to postpone giving every single child in America, no matter their zip code, pre-K all the way through high school and beyond. I refuse to postpone any longer taking on climate change, and leading the world in taking on climate change. Look, this is the United States of America. There has never been a single, solitary time when weíve set our mind to something that weíve not been able to do it. Weíre walking around with our heads down, like, ìWoe is me.î Weíre the best equipped nation in the world to take this on. Itís no longer time to postpone. We should get moving. Thereís enormous, enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump."
2019-09-12,Biden,"Thatíll be for the voters to decide that question. Let me tell you what I think. I think we should have a debate on health care. I know that the senator says sheís for Bernie. Well, Iím for Barack. I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way in which we add to it, replace everything thatís been cut, add a public option. Guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance, number one."
2019-09-12,Biden,"Number two, I think we should be in a position of taking a look at what costs are. My plan for health care costs a lot of money. It costs $740 billion. It doesnít cost $30 trillion. $3.4 trillion a year, it turns out, is twice what the entire federal budget is. Thatís before it exists now, without interest on the debt. How are we going to pay for it? I want to hear tonight how thatís happened."
2019-09-12,Biden,"As far as my distinguished friend, the senator on my left, has not indicated how she pays for it. The senator has in fact come forward and said how heís going to pay for it, but it gets him about halfway there. Thereís a lot of other things that need to be done. I have a bold plan to deal with making sure we triple the money for at risk schools, that are title one schools, from $15 to $45 billion a year. I go down the line, and each of the things weíre talking about, I lay out how I can pay for it, how I can get it done, and why itís better."
2019-09-12,Warren,"Letís be clear about healthcare, and letís actually start where Vice President did. We all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally transformed healthcare in America, and committed this country to healthcare for every human being. Now the question is, how best can we improve on it? I believe the best way we can do that is we make sure that everybody gets covered by healthcare at the lowest possible cost. How do we pay for it? We pay for it. Those at the very top, the richest individuals, and the biggest corporations, are going to pay more, and middle class families are going to pay less. Thatís how this is going to work."
2019-09-12,Warren,"Look, what families have to deal with is cost. Total cost. Thatís what they have to deal with. Understand. Families are paying for their health care today. Families pay every time an insurance company says, ìSorry, you canít see that specialist.î Every time an insurance company says, ìSorry, that doctor is out of network. Sorry. We are not covering that prescription.î Families are paying every time they donít get a prescription filled because they canít pay for it. They donít have a lump checked out because they canít afford the copay. What weíre talking about here is whatís going to happen in familiesí pockets. Whatís going to happen in their budgets. The answer is, on Medicare for all, costs are going to go up for wealthier individuals, and costs are going to go up for giant corporations, but for hardworking families across this country, costs are going to go down. Thatís how it should work under Medicare for all in our health care."
2019-09-12,Sanders,"Joe said that Medicare for all would cost over $30 trillion. Thatís right, Joe. Status quo over 10 years will be $50 trillion. Every study done shows that Medicare for all is the most cost effective approach to providing healthcare to every man, woman, and child in this country. I, who wrote the damn bill, if I may say so, intend to eliminate all out of pocket expenses. All deductibles. All copayments. Nobody in America will pay more than $200 a year for prescription drugs, because weíre going to stand up to the greed, and corruption, and price fixing of the pharmaceutical industry. We need a health care system that guarantees health care to all people as every other major country does, not a system which provides $100 billion a year in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies. To tell you how absurd the system is, tonight on ABC, the healthcare industry will be advertising, telling you how bad Medicare for all is, because they want to protect their profits. That is absurd."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"If I could respond, George."
2019-09-12,Biden,"Okay. Number one, my healthcare plan does significantly cut the cost. The largest out of pocket payment youíll pay is $1,000. Youíll be able to get into aÖ Anyone who canít afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare type option we have, et cetera, but guess what? Of the 160 million people who liked their health care now, they can keep it. If they donít like it, they can leave. Number one."
2019-09-12,Biden,"Number two. The fact of the matter is, weíre in a situation where, if you noticed, he hadnít answered the question. This is about candor, honesty, big ideas. Letís have a big idea. The tax of 2% the senatorís talking about? That raises about $3 billion. Guess what? That leaves you about $28 billion short. The senator said before, itís going to cost you in your pay. There will be a deductible in your paycheck. The middle class person, someone making 60 grand for three kids, theyíre going to end up paying $5,000 more. Theyíre going to end up paying 4% more on their income tax. Thatís a reality. Now, itís not a bad idea, if you like it. I donít like it."
2019-09-12,Warren,"Letís be clear. Iíve actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company. Iíve met people who like their doctors. Iíve met people who like their nurses. Iíve met people who like their pharmacists. I met people who like their physical therapists. What they want is access to health care, and we just need to be clear about what Medicare for all is all about. Instead of paying premiums into insurance companies, and then having insurance companies build their profits by saying no to coverage, weíre going to do this by saying everyone is covered by Medicare for all. Every healthcare provider is covered. The only question here, in terms of difference, is where to send the bill."
2019-09-12,Sanders,"Let us be clear, Joe. In the United States of America, we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians, or any other major country on earth."
2019-09-12,Biden,This is America.
2019-09-12,Sanders,"Yeah, but Americans donít want to pay twice as much as other countries, and they guarantee health care to all people. Under my Medicare for all proposal, when you donít pay out of pocket, and you donít pay premiumsÖ Maybe you have run into people who love their premiums. I havenít. What people want is cost effective health care. Medicare for all will save the average American substantial sums of money on his or her health care bill."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"I think you know that I donít agree with some of these proposals up here, George. Iím talking aboutÖ"
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"If I could respond to some of the proposals, but from my friends. First of all, Senator Sanders and I have worked valiantly to bring down the cost of pharmaceuticals. That was a Klobuchar Sanders amendment, to allow for drugs to come in from less expensive countries like Canada. We have worked to bring down the costs by fighting to allow 43 million seniors, thatís a bill I lead, to negotiate for better prices under Medicare. I figure thatís a lot of seniors, and they should be allowed to get a better price."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"When it comes to our health care, and when it comes to our premiums, I go with the doctorís creed, which is do no harm. While Bernie wrote the bill, I read the bill. On page eight, on page eight of the bill, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it. That means that 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance. Thatís in four years. I donít think thatís a bold idea. I think itís a bad idea. What I favor is something that what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning, and that is a public option. A nonprofit choice that will bring down the cost of insurance, cover 12 million more people, and bring down the prices for 13 million more people. That is a bold idea."
2019-09-12,Warren,Iím sorry.
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,Current health insurance.
2019-09-12,Biden,149 million.
2019-09-12,Warren,"Letís be clear about this. People will have access to all of their doctors, all of their nurses, their community hospitals, their rural hospitals. Doctors wonít have to hire people to fill out crazy forms. They wonít have to spend time on the phone arguing with insurance companies. People who have sick family members wonít have to get into these battles. What this is about is making sure that we have the most efficient way possible to pay for health care for everyone in this country. Insurance companies last year sucked $23 billion in profits out of the system. How did they make that money? Every one of those $23 billion was made by an insurance company saying no to your healthcare company."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"The problem, Senator Sanders, with that damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backedÖ"
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"Ö with that damn bill that you wrote, and that Senator Warren backs, is that it doesnít trust the American people. I trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you. Not ìMy way or the highwayî. Now look, I think we do have to go far beyond tinkering with the ACA. I propose Medicare for all who want it. We take a version of Medicare, we make it available for the American people, and if weíre right as progressives that that public alternative is better, then the American people will figure that out for themselves. I trust the American people to make the right choice for them, whey donít you?"
2019-09-12,Sanders,"George, you talked about, was it 150 million people on private insurance? 50 million of those people lose their private insurance every year when they quit their jobs, or they go unemployed, or their employer changes their insurance policy. Medicare for All is comprehensive healthcare, covers all basic needs, including home healthcare. It allows you to go to any doctor you want, which many private insurance company programs do not. So if you want comprehensive healthcare, freedom of choice regarding doctor or hospital, no more than 200 dollars a year for prescription drugs, taking on the drug companies and the insurance companies, moving to Medicare for All is a way to go."
2019-09-12,Harris,"I want to give credit first to Barrack Obama for really bringing us this far. We would not be here if he hadnít the courage, the talent, or the will to see us this far. I want to give credit to Bernie. Take credit, Bernie. You brought us this far in Medicare for All. I support Medicare for All, I always have, but I wanted to make the plan better, which I did. Which is about offering people choice, not taking that from them. So under my Medicare for All plan people have the choice of a private plan or a public plan, because thatís what people want, and I agree we shouldnít take choice from people. But hereís the thing, everybody on this stage I do believe is well-intentioned and wants that all Americans have coverage and recognizes that right now 30 million Americans donít have coverage. But at least five people have talked, some repeatedly on this subject, and not once have we talked about Donald Trump."
2019-09-12,Harris,"So letís talk about the fact that Donald Trump came into office and spent almost the entire first year of his term trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. We all fought against it, and then the late great John McCain, at that moment at about 2:00 in the morning, killed his attempt to take healthcare from millions of people in this country. Fast-forward to today, and what is happening? Donald Trumpís Department of Justice is trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Donald Trumpís administration is trying to get rid of the ban that we placed on denying people who have preexisting conditions coverage. Donald Trump is trying to say that our kids up to the age of 26 can no longer be on our plans, and frankly I think this discussion have given the American public a headache. What they want to know is that theyíre going to have healthcare and cost will not be a barrier to getting it. But letís focus on the end goal. If we donít get Donald Trump out of office heís going to get rid of all of it."
2019-09-12,Biden,15 seconds?
2019-09-12,Biden,"15 seconds. Look, everybody says we want an option. The option Iím proposing is a Medicare for All in a Medicare for choice. If you want Medicare, if you lose the job from your employer, you automatically can buy into this. You donít have no preexisting condition can stop you from buying in. You get covered. Period. And if you notice, nobodyís yet said how much itís going to cost the taxpayer. I hear this large savings. My friend from Vermont thinks that employerís going to give you back if negotiate his union all these years, got to cut wages because youíve got insurance. Theyíre going to give back that money to the employee?"
2019-09-12,Sanders,As a matter of fact they will with our bill.
2019-09-12,Biden,"Well, let me tell you something, for a socialist you got a lot more confidence in corporate America than I do."
2019-09-12,Sanders,"One minute, George?"
2019-09-12,Sanders,"All right. Two points. You got to defend the fact that today, not only do we 87 million people uninsured and underinsured, you got to defend the fact that 500000 Americans are going bankrupt. You know why theyíre going bankrupt? Because they suffered a terrible disease. Cancer or heart disease. Under my legislation people will not go into financial ruin because they suffered with a diagnosis of cancer, and our program is the only one that does that."
2019-09-12,Biden,"I know a lot about cancer. Let me tell you something. Itís personal to me. Let me tell you something. Every single person who is diagnosed with cancer or any other disease can automatically become part of this plan. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They will not go bankrupt because of that. They can join immediately, and weíre talking four, six, eight, 10 years, depending on you talk about, before we get to Medicare for All. Come on. Iíve been there. Youíve been there. You know what itís like. People need help now, hope now, and do something now."
2019-09-12,Biden,This is the [crosstalk 00:34:46] plan.
2019-09-12,Castro,"Thank you. I also want to recognize the work that Bernie has done on this, and of course we owe a debt of gratitude to President Barrack Obama. Of course, I also worked for President Obama, Vice President Biden, and I know that the problem with your plan is that it leaves 10 million people uncovered. Now, on the last debate stage in Detroit you said that wasnít true when Senator Harris brought that up. There was a fact check of that and they said that was true. I grew up with a grandmother who had Type Two diabetes and I watched her condition get worse and worse, but that whole time she had Medicare. I want every single American family to have a strong Medicare plan available."
2019-09-12,Castro,"If they choose to hold onto strong solid private health insurance, I believe they should be able to do that, but the difference between what I support and what you support, Vice President Biden, is that you require them to opt in, and I would not require them to opt in, they would automatically be enrolled. They wouldnít have to buy in. Thatís a big difference, because Barrack Obamaís vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered. He wanted every single person in this country covered. My plan would do that. Your plan would not."
2019-09-12,Biden,They do not have to buy in. They do not have to buy in.
2019-09-12,Castro,You just said that. You just said that two minutes ago. You just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy in.
2019-09-12,Biden,They do not have to buy in if they canít afford it.
2019-09-12,Castro,You said they would have to buy in.
2019-09-12,Biden,"Your grandmother would not have to buy in. If she qualified for Medicaid, sheíd automatically be in for it."
2019-09-12,Castro,"Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago? I canít believe that you said two minute ago that they had to buy in, and now youíre saying they donít have to buy in. Youíre forgetting that."
2019-09-12,Biden,"I said anyone, like your grandmother, who has no money, youíre automatically enrolled."
2019-09-12,Castro,"We need a healthcare system that automatically enrolls people regardless of whether they choose to opt in or not. If you lose your job for instance, his healthcare plan would not automatically enroll you, you would have to opt in. My healthcare plan would. Thatís a big difference. Iím fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and youíre not."
2019-09-12,Biden,Thatíll be a surprise to him.
2019-09-12,Yang,"Come on, guys. Come on."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"This is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable, because this reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington, scoring points against each other, poking at each other, and telling each other that ìYour plan, my planî. Look, we all-"
2019-09-12,Castro,"Yeah, thatís called the Democratic Primary Election. Thatís called an election. Thatís an election. This is what weíre here for, itís an election."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"Yeah, but a house divided cannot stand, and that is not how weíre going to win this election."
2019-09-12,Yang,"Look, everyone, we know weíre on the same team here. We know weíre on the same team. We all have a better vision for healthcare than our current president, and I believe weíre talking about this the wrong way. As someone who has a business, I know that our current healthcare system makes it harder to hire people, it makes it harder to give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees. You instead pretend theyíre contractors. Itís harder to change jobs. Itís certainly harder to start a business. The pitch we have to make to the American people is we will get the healthcare weight off of your backs and then unleash the hopes and dreams of the American people."
2019-09-12,Yang,"Now, I am Asian, so I know a lot of doctors, and they tell me that they spend a lot of time on paperwork, avoiding being sued, and navigating the insurance bureaucracy. We have to change the incentives so instead of revenue and activity people are focused on our health in the healthcare system, and the Cleveland Clinic where theyíre paid not based upon how many procedures they prescribe, shocker, they prescribe fewer procedures, and patient health stays the same or improves. That is the pitch to the American people."
2019-09-12,Booker,"Thank you very much. Look, there are a lot of people watching at home right now, listening to us, that are afraid because they are in crisis. They donít have health insurance, or health insurance doesnít go far enough, they canít afford their prescription drugs. Look, Iím clear on what I believe. I believe in Medicare for All. I believe itís the best way to rationalize the system, but dear god, I know that every one of my colleagues on this stage is in favor of universal health coverage, and comes at this with the best of intentions. Iíll tell you, there is an urgency right now in this nation. Everybody feels it. As a person who has an ideal, I know we cannot sacrifice progress on the alter of purity, because people in my community, they need help right now."
2019-09-12,Booker,"They have high blood pressure right now. They have unaffordable insulin right now. And this must be a moment where we as Democrats can begin to show that we cannot only stake and stand our ground, but find common ground, because weíve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one- term president, and we cannot lose it by the way we talk about each other, or demonize and degrade each other. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. If I am the leader I will work towards the ideal of health insurance, health coverage being a right for all Americans, but every single day Iíll join with other Democrats to make progress happen in our nation for the people that are struggling and suffering today."
2019-09-12,Castro,"I want to commend Beto for how well he has spoken to the passion and the frustration and the sadness after what happened in his hometown of El Paso. Heís done a great job with that. Look, a few weeks ago a shooter drove 10 hours, inspired by this president, to kill people who look like me and people who look like my family. White supremacy is a growing threat to this country, and we have to root it out. Iím proud that I put forward a plan to disarm hate. Iím also proud that I was the first to put forward a police reform plan, because weíre not going have anymore Laquan McDonalds, or Eric Garners, or Michael Browns, or Pamela Turners, or Walter Scotts, or Sandra Bland here from the Houston area. We need to root out racism, and I believe that we can do that, because that doesnít represent the vast majority of Americans who do have a good heart. They also need a leader to match that, and I will be a president that matches that."
2019-09-12,Booker,"Well, first and foremost, I want to hit that point, because we know Donald Trumpís a racist, but there is no red badge of courage for calling him that. Racism exists, the question isnít ìWho isnít a racistî, itís ìWho is and isnít doing something about racism?î And this is not just an issue that started yesterday. Itís not just an issue that we hear a president that canít condemn white supremacy. We have systemic racism that is eroding our nation, from healthcare to the criminal justice system. And itís nice to go all the way back to slavey, but dear god, we have a criminal justice system that is so racially biased we have more African-Americans under criminal supervision today that all the slaves in 1850."
2019-09-12,Booker,"We have to come at this issue attacking systemic racism, having the courage to call it out and having a plan to do something about it. If I am President of the United States, we will create an office in the White House to deal with the problem of white supremacy and hate crimes, and we will make sure that systemic racism is dealt with in substantive plans from criminal justice reform to the disparities in healthcare, to even one that we donít talk about enough, which is the racism that we see in environmental injustice in communities of color all around this country."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"I believe whatís deepened divisions in the country is the conduct of this president, and we have a change all of that. Look, systemic racism preceded this president, and even when we defeat him it will be with us. Thatís why we need a systemic approach to dismantle it. Itís not enough to just take a racist policy, replace it with a neutral one and expect things will just get better on their own. Harmsí compound in the same way that a dollar saved compound, so does a dollar stolen, and we know that the generational theft of the descendants of slaves is part of why everything from housing to education to health to employment basically puts in two different countries. I have proposed the most comprehensive vision to tackle systemic racism in every one of these areas."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"Marshaling as many resources as went into the Marshal Plan that rebuilt Europe, but this time a Douglas Plan that we invest right here at home, to make sure that weíre not only dealing with things like the over-incarceration of black Americans, but also black solutions. Entrepreneurship, raising to 25% the target for the federal government to do business with minority-owned businesses. Investing in HPCUs that are training and educating the next generation of entrepreneurs. We can and must do that, but that means transcending this framework that pits us against each other, that pits a single black mother of three against a displaced autoworker, because where I come from a lot of times that displaced autoworker is a single black mother of three. Weíve got to say that and bring people together."
2019-09-12,Harris,"Iím glad you asked me this question, and there have been many distortions of my record. Let me be very clear. I made a decision to become a prosecutor for two reasons, one, Iíve always wanted to protect people and keep them safe, and second, I was born knowing about how this criminal justice system in America has worked in a way that has been informed by racial bias, and I could tell you extensively about the experiences I and my family members have personally had. But I made a decision that if I was going to have the ability to reform the system, I would try to do it from the inside. So I took on the position that allowed me, without asking permission, to create one of the first in the nation initiatives that was a model and became a national model around people who are arrested for drugs and getting them jobs. I created one of the first in the nation requirements that a state law enforcement agency would have to wear cameras and keep them on full-time."
2019-09-12,Harris,"I created one of the first in the nation training for police officers on the issue of racial bias and the need to reform the system. Was I able to get enough done? Absolutely not, but my plan has been described by activists as being a bold and comprehensive plan that is about ending mass incarceration, about taking the profit out of the criminal justice system. I plan on shutting down for-profit prisons on day one. It will be about what we need to do to hold law enforcement, including prosecutors, accountable, and finally, my plan is about making sure that in Americaís criminal justice system we de-incarcerate woman and children, that we end solitary confinement, and that we work on keeping families intact. And as President of the United States, knowing the system from the inside, I will have the ability to be an effective leader and get this job complete."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"Thatís not my record. We are here at a historically black college, and I think of an alum of that college, Barbara Jordan, and something she once said. She said ìWhat the people want is simple. They want a country as good as itís promiseî, and that same can be said of the criminal justice system. So when I was there, the way we handled these police shootings, I actually took a stand make sure outside investigators handled them. I took on our major police chief in Minneapolis, but in the prosecutorís office they were handled with a grand jury. Thatís how they were all handled across our state. I now believe it is better for accountability if the prosecutor handles them and makes those decisions herself. That aside, I am proud of the work our staff did, 400 people in our office. The cases that came to us, the African-American community that came to us, they said there was no justice for their little kids. There was a kid named Byron Philips that was shot on his front porch. No one had bothered to figure out who did it."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"When I came into that office, we worked with the community groups, we put up billboards, we found the shooter and we put him in jail. We did the same for the killer of a little girl named Taisha Edwards who was doing her homework at her kitchen table and was shot through the window. What changes did we make? Go after white collar crimes in a big way. Diversify the office in a big way. Work with the Innocence Project to make sure we do much better with eyewitness ID, and as a senator and as your President I will make sure that we donít just do the First Step Act when it comes to criminal sentencing, that we move to the Second Step Act, which means the 90% of people that are incarcerated in local and state jails, letís reduce those sentences for non-violent offenders and letís get them jobs and let them vote when they get out of prison."
2019-09-12,Biden,"Well, first of all, let me say that when I came back from law school I had a job with a big time law firm. I left and became a public defender because my state was under siege. When Dr. King was assassinated we were occupied by the National Guard for 10 months. Iíve been involved from the beginning. As a young councilman I introduced legislation to try to keep them putting a sewer plant in a poor neighborhood. I made sure that we dealt with redlining. Banks should have to lend where they operate, etc. The fact of the matter is that whatís happened is that weíre in a situation now where there are so many people who are in jail and shouldnít be in jail. The whole means by which this should change is the whole model has to change. We should be talking about rehabilitation. Nobody should be in jail for a non-violent crime. When we were in the White House we released 36000 people from the federal prison system. Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem."
2019-09-12,Biden,"They should be going directly to a rehabilitation. We build more rehabilitation centers, not prisons. Iím the guy that put in the drug courts to divert people from the criminal justice system. So we have to change the whole way we look at this, and we put people in prison, we have to equip them when they get out. Nobody who got in prison for marijuana for example immediately upon being released they shouldnít be in there for a misdemeanor. That should be a misdemeanor, they should be out and their record should be expunged. Every single right should be returned. When you finish your term in prison you should be able to not only vote, but have access to Pell Grants, have access to be able to get housing, have access to be able to move along the way. Iíve laid out a detailed plan along those lines, and the fact is weíve learned so much more about-"
2019-09-12,Biden,Thank you.
2019-09-12,Booker,"Our criminal justice system is so savagely broken. Thereís no difference in American between blacks, whites, and Latinos for using drugs or dealing drugs, but if youíre African-American youíre almost four times more likely to be arrested and incarcerated, destroying your lives. And so much of this comes down to privilege. We have a criminal justice system that Bryan Stevenson says ìTreats you better if youíre rich and guilty than if youíre poor and innocentî. So I have challenged this whole field. We can specifically and demonstratively now show that there are 17000 people unjustly incarcerated in America, and all of us should come forward and say ìWhen I am President of the United States we will release themî, and let me be specific. I joined together and led in the United States Senate the only major bipartisan bill to pass onto this president for criminal justice reform, that has already led to 1000s of people coming out of jail."
2019-09-12,Booker,"If 87 members of the United States Senate says that these sentences are way too long and we changed it, but we didnít make it retractive, we could literally point to the people that are in jail unjustly right now. Everyone on this stage should say that we are going to give clemency to these 17000 people, and I challenge you, donít just say big statements, back it up with details of the people in prison right now looking for one of the most sacrosanct ideals of this nation, which is liberty and freedom. We need to reform this system and we must do it now. Every day we wait is too long."
2019-09-12,Biden,"Because Iíve got it done before. Iím the only one up here whoís ever beat the NRA. Only one to ever beat the NRA nationally. Iím the guy that brought the Brady Bill into focus and became law. So thatís number one. Number two, after Sandy Hook a number of things happened. Itís went from a cause to a movement. Look whatís happened now. Mothers, the organization, Mothers Against Gun Violence. Weíve seen whatís happened again. Now we have all these young people marching on Washington, making sure that things are going to change. There has been a sea change. Those proposals I put forward for the president had over 50% of members of the NRA supporting them, and overwhelmingly the rest of the people supporting them. Now the numbers are much higher, because they realize what Iíve been saying, and weíve all been saying, is correct. Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons Ö"
2019-09-12,Biden,"Correct. Over 90% of the American people think we have to get assault weapons off the street, period. And we have to get buybacks and get them out of their basements. So the point is things have changed and things have changed a lot and now whatís happening is, and by the way, the way Beto handled, excuse me for saying Beto congressman."
2019-09-12,Biden,"The way he handled what happened in his home town is meaningful. The look in the eyes of those people to see those kids, to understand those parents, to understand the heartache, we are ready to do this."
2019-09-12,Harris,Thatís right.
2019-09-12,Biden,"Some things you can, many things you canít."
2019-09-12,Harris,"I mean I would just say, ìHey Joe instead of saying that we canít let say yes we can.î"
2019-09-12,Biden,Thatís not constitutional. We got a constitution.
2019-09-12,Harris,"Yes we can. Because Iíll tell you something. The way that I think about this is Iíve seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you. I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you. I have hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you. And the idea that we would wait for this congress, which has just done nothing to act is justÖ It is overlooking the fact that every day in America our babies are going to school to have drills. Elementary, middle and high school students where they are learning about how they have to hide in a closet or crouch in a corner if there is a mass shooter roaming the hallways of their school."
2019-09-12,Harris,"I was talking about this at one of my town halls and this child was eight years old probably, came up to me. It was like it was a secret between the two of us and he tugged on my jacket and he said, ìI had to have one of those drills.î It is traumatizing our children, El Paso and Beto God love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy. People asked me in El Paso, they said, because I have a long standing record on this issue. They said, ìWell, do you think Trump is responsible for what happened?î And I said, ìWell, look. I mean, obviously he didnít pull the trigger, but heís certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.î"
2019-09-12,Biden,"What I said was speak to constitutional scholars. If in fact we could say, ìBy the way, you canít own the following weapons period. It cannot be sold anymore.î Check with constitutional scholars."
2019-09-12,Harris,Could I tell you what you could do to respond today?
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"I so appreciate what the congressmanís been doing and I want to remind people here that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. Everyone up here favors an assault weapon pan. Everyone up here favors magazine limitations, which by the way would have made a huge difference if that was in place in El Paso, in that store where all those ordinary people showed such extraordinary courage and certainly in Dayton, Ohio, where in 30 seconds one man guns down innocent people. The cops got there in one minute and it still wasnít enough to save those people. Thatís what unites us."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"You know what else unites us? And Iíll tell you this, what unites us is that right now on Mitch McConnellís desk are three bills, universal background checks, closing the Charleston loophole and passing my bill to make sure that domestic abusers donít get AK47."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"Itís time to get something done. And I personally think we should start with the voluntary buyback program. Thatís what I think David. But I want to finish this because if you want action now, we got to send a message to Mitch McConnell. We canít wait until one of us gets in the White House. We have to pass those bills right now to get this done."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,Because we cannot spare another innocent life.
2019-09-12,Booker,"So background checks and gun licensing, these are agreed to by overwhelmingly the majority of Americans, 83% of Americans agree with licensing. This is the issue. Look, I grew up in the suburbs. It was about 20 years ago that I came out of my home when I moved to inner city New Jersey, and witnessed the aftermath of a shooting. Itís one of the reasons why shooting after shooting in neighborhoods like mine for decades, this has been a crisis for me. Itís why I was the first person to come out for gun licensing. And Iím happy that people like Beto OíRourke are showing such courage now and coming forward and also now supporting licensing, but this is what Iím sorry about. Iím sorry that it had to take issues coming to my neighborhood or personally affecting Beto to suddenly make us demand change. This is a crisis of empathy in our nation."
2019-09-12,Booker,"We are never going to solve this crisis if we have to wait for it to personally affect us or our neighborhood, our community before we demand action. You want to know how we get this done? We get this done by having a more courageous empathy where people donít wait for this hell to visit upon their communities. They stand up and understand the truth of what King said, that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. I will lead change on this issue because I have seen what the carnage creates in communities like mine. Because we forget national shootings, these mass shootings or tragedies, but the majority of the homicide victims come from neighborhoods like mine. Nobody has ascended to the White House that will bring more personal passion on this issue. I will fight this and bring a fight to the NRA and the corporate gun lobby like they have never seen before."
2019-09-12,Booker,"If that was the attitude when Strom Thurmond had the longest filibuster ever on civil rights. If it was this idea that we canít get it done because of the situation in the Senate, Iím looking to lead a movement. The number one reason why governments are formed is to protect the citizenry. Think about this. We have had more people die due to gun violence in my lifetime than every single war in this country combined from the revolutionary war till now. This is not a side issue to me, it is a central issue to me. That is the kind of fight because the majority of homicide victims, we have a mass shooting every single day in communities like mine."
2019-09-12,Booker,"We must awaken a more courageous empathy in this country, so we stand together and fight together and overwhelm those Republicans who are not even representing their constituency. Because the majority of Americans, the majority of gun owners agree with me, not the corporate gun lobby. It is time for a movement on this issue and I will lead it."
2019-09-12,Warren,"So letís start by framing the problem the right way. We have a gun violence problem in this country. The mass shootings are terrible, but they get all the headlines. Children die every day on streets, in neighborhoods, on playgrounds. People die from violence, from suicide and domestic abuse. We have a gun violence problem in this country and we agree on many steps we could take to fix it. My view on this is itís not going to be won and done on this. Weíre going to do it and weíre going to have to do it again and weíre going to have to come back some more until we cut the number of gun deaths in this country significantly. But hereís the deal. The question we need to ask is when weíve got this much support across the country, 90% of Americans want to see us doÖ"
2019-09-12,Warren,"I like registrationÖ Want to see us do background checks, want to get assault weapons off the streets. Why doesnít it happen? And the answer is corruption, pure and simple. We have a congress that is beholden to the gun industry and unless weíre willing to address that head on and roll back the filibuster, weíre not going to get anything done on guns. I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said, letís do background checks, letís get rid of assault weapons and with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster. Until we attack the systemic problems. We canít get done reform in this country. Weíve got to go straight against the industry and weíve got to change congress so it doesnít just work for the wealthy and well conducted. So it works for the people."
2019-09-12,Sanders,"No, but what I would support absolutely is passing major legislation, the gun legislation the people here are talking about. Medicare for all, climate change legislation that saves the planet. I will not wait for 60 votes to make that happen. And you could do it in a variety of ways. You could do that through budget reconciliation law. You have a vice president who will in fact tell the senate what is appropriate and what is not, what is an order and what is not."
2019-09-12,Sanders,"But I want to get back to a point that Elizabeth made and that in fact, in terms of gun issues, picking up on Corey and Beto and everybody else, what we are looking at is a corrupt political system. And that means whether it is the drug companies or the insurance companies or the fossil fuel industry determining whatís happening in Washington or in this case you got an NRA which has intimidated the president of the United States and the Republican leadership. I am proud that year after year I had an F rating from the NRA and as president, I will not be intimidated by the NRA."
2019-09-12,Harris,Can I respond?
2019-09-12,Biden,"What Latinos should look at is comparing this president to the president we have is outrageous. Number one, we didnít lock people up in cages. We didnít separate families. We didnít do all of those things, number one. Number two, this is the president who came along with the DACA program, no one had ever done that before, the president sent legislation to desk saying he wants to find a pathway for the 11 million undocumented in the United States of America. This is the president has done a great deal, so Iím proud to have served with him. What I would do as president is several more things because things have changed."
2019-09-12,Biden,"I would in fact make sure that we immediately surge to the border. All those people are seeking asylum, they deserve to be heard. Thatís who we are. Weíre a nation that says if you want to flee and youíre fleeing oppression, you should come. I would change the order that the president just changed saying women who were being beaten and abused could no longer claim that as a reason for asylum. And by the way, retrospectively, you know the 25th anniversary of the violence against women act is up. The Republican Congress has not reauthorized it. Letís put pressure on them to pass the violence against women act now."
2019-09-12,Biden,The president did the best thing that was able to be done at the time.
2019-09-12,Biden,Iím the vice president of the United States.
2019-09-12,Castro,"Jorge, thank you very much for that question. And you look, I agree that Barack Obama was very different from Donald Trump. Donald Trump has a dark heart when it comes to immigrants. He built his whole political career so far on scapegoating and fear-mongering and otherizing migrants, and thatís very different for Barack Obama. But my problem with vice president Biden and Corey pointed this out last time, is every time something good about Barack Obama comes up, he says, ìI was there. Thatís me too.î And then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, ìWell, that was the president.î I mean, he wants to take credit for Obamaís work, but not have to answer to any questions."
2019-09-12,Castro,I donít get that.
2019-09-12,Castro,Let me just say-
2019-09-12,Biden,Thatís not what I said. Thatís not what I said.
2019-09-12,Castro,"I was the first candidate in early April to put forward an immigration plan. You know why? Because Iím not afraid of Donald Trump on this issue. Iím not going to back pedal. Iím not going to pretend like I donít have my own vision for immigration. So weíre not going to give up DACA. Weíre not going to give up protections for anybody. I believe that on January 20th, 2021 weíre going to have a democratic president. Weíre going to throw out Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn and have a democratic Senate and a democratic house, and weíre going to pass immigration reform within the first hundred days."
2019-09-12,Biden,"I did not say donít standÖ I stand with Barack Obama all eight years. Good, bad, and indifferent. Thatís where I stand. I did not say I did not stand with him."
2019-09-12,Warren,"Well, I start with a statement of principles and that is in this country, immigration does not make us weaker, immigration makes us stronger. I want to see us expand legal immigration and create a pathway to citizenship for our dreamers, but also for their grandparents and for their cousins, for people whoís overstayed student visas, and for people who came here to work in the fields. I want to have a system that is a path to citizenship that is fair and achievable. Down at the border, weíve got to rework this entirely. A system right now that cannot tell the difference in the threat posed by a terrorist, a criminal and a 12 year old girl is not a system that is keeping us safer and it is not serving our values."
2019-09-12,Warren,"I want to add one more part on this because I think we have to look at all the pieces. Why do we have a crisis at the border? In no small part because we have withdrawn help from people in Central America who are suffering. We need to restore that help, we need to help establish and reestablish the rule of law so that people donít feel like they have to flee for their lives. We have a crisis that Donald Trump has created and hopes to profit from politically. We have to have the courage to stand up and fight back."
2019-09-12,Warren,Did you ask me?
2019-09-12,Warren,"He said it, okay. Sorry."
2019-09-12,Yang,"My father grew up on a peanut farm in Asia with no floor and now his son is running for president. That is the immigration story that we have to be able to share it with the American people. If you look at our history, almost half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by either immigrants or children of immigrants and rates of business formation are much higher in immigrant communities. We have to say to the American people, immigrants are positive for economic and social dynamism. And I would return the level of legal immigration to the point it was under the Obama, Biden administration."
2019-09-12,Yang,"I think we have to compete for talent and I am the opposite of Donald Trump in many ways. He says, ìBuild a wall.î Iím going to say to immigrants, ìCome to America, because if you come here, your son or daughter can run for president. The waterís great and this is where you want to build a company, build a family, and build a life.î This country has been a magnet for human capital for generations. If we lose that, we lose something integral to our continued success and that is where I would lead as president."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"Anyone who supports this is supporting racism. [foreign language 00:22:43]. The only people though who actually buy into this presidentís hateful rhetoric around immigrants are people who donít know any. We have an opportunity to build an American majority around immigration reform. In my community, a group of conservative Republicans rallied around an individual, a beloved local individual who was deported when he went in to ICE to try to get his paperwork sorted out because they never thought it would happen to him. In some of the most conservative rural areas of Iowa, I have seen communities that embraced immigration grow. And itís why part of my plan for revitalizing the economies of rural America, includes community renewal visas that would allow cities and towns and counties that are hurting not only for jobs, but for population to embrace immigration as we have in my city."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"The only reason that South Bend is growing right now after years of shrinking is immigration. Itís one of the reasons we acted, not waiting for Washington to create city issued municipal IDs. So that people regardless of immigration status in our city, had the opportunity to have the benefits of identification. We have an opportunity to actually get something done."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"But we cannot allow this to continue to be the same debate with the same arguments and the same clever lines, often among the same people since the last real reform happened in the 1980s. We have to actually engage the American majority around the opportunities for not just growth in small communities, but our values. Values of welcome, values of faith that all argue for us to manage this humanely and in a way that marries our values with our laws."
2019-09-12,Yang,"I would not repeal the tariffs on day one, but I would let the Chinese know that we need to hammer out a deal. Because right now the tariffs are pummeling producers and farmers in Iowa who have absolutely nothing to do with the imbalances that we have with China."
2019-09-12,Yang,"A CEO friend of mine was in China recently and he said that he saw pirated US intellectual property on worker workstations to the tune of thousands of dollars per head. And he said, ìOne, how can my workers compete against that? And two, think about all the lost revenue to American companies.î So the imbalances are real, but we have to let the Chinese know that we recognize that president Trump has pursued an arbitrary and haphazard trade policy that has had victims on both sides. So no to repealing the tariffs immediately, but yes, to making sure we come to a deal that addresses the concerns of American companies and American producers."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"Well, the president clearly has no strategy. You know, when I first got into this race, I remember president Trump scoffed and said heíd like to see me making a deal with Xi Jinping. Iíd like to see him making a deal with Xi Jinping."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"Is it just me or was that supposed to happen in like April? Itís one more example of a commitment not made. When that happens on the international stage, people take note, not just our competitors, our adversaries, but also our allies. Take note of the inability of the United States to keep its word or follow through on its plans. And when that happens, there are serious consequences."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"We saw it at the G7, the leaders of some of the greatest powers and economies of the world sitting to talk about one of the greatest challenges in the world, climate change, and there was literally an empty chair where American leadership could have been. The problem is this is a moment when American leadership is needed more than ever, whether itís in Hong Kong where those protestors for democracy need to know that they have a friend in the United States or anywhere around the world where increasingly we see dictators throwing their weight around. The world needs America, but it canít be just any America. [crosstalk 00:02:52]."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"I would have a strategy that would include the tariffs as leverage, but itís not about the tariffs. Look whatís going on right now is a president who has reduced the entire China challenge into a question of of tariffs, when what we know is that the tariffs are coming down on us more than anybody else, and thereís a lack of a bigger strategy."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"What weíve got right now though, George, itís not a focus tariff on steel. What he has done here, he has assessed these tariffs on our allies. He has put us in the middle of this trade war and he is treating our farmers and our workers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos. And if we are not careful, he is going to bankrupt this country."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"One forecast recently says that it has already cost us 300,000 jobs. All right? There is soybeans that are mounting up in bins all over the Midwest in my state of Minnesota and in Iowa. So what I think we need to do is to go back to the negotiating table. Thatís what I would do. I wouldnít have put all these tariffs in place and I wouldnít have had a trade policy where on August 1st he announces heís going to have tariffs on $300 billion of goods, on August 13th he cuts it in half, a week later he says heís going to reduce taxes. The day after that he says heís not going to do it."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"The leaders of the world are watching this and it undermines our strength as a nation. And yes, we want fair trade, but we must work with the rest of the world and he has made a mockery of focused trade policy, which I think means enforcement like weíve done in Northern Minnesota, passing bills, getting president Obama to do more on that so that our workers can benefit. So we are importing, exporting goods and making sure that it is a competitive policy where our goal is that we are making things, inventing things and exporting to the world. He is defeating that goal."
2019-09-12,Castro,"Well, look, I agree with those who have said that this erratic, haphazard trade war is hurting American families. As Senator Klobuchar said, 300,000 American jobs. Itís estimated that itís cost $600 to the average American family. Just a couple of days ago 60% of Americans said that they believe that weíre in for a recession next year."
2019-09-12,Castro,"So when I become president, I would immediately begin to negotiate with China to ratchet down that trade war. We have leverage there. I also believe though, that we need to return to a leader when it comes to things like human rights. We have millions of Uyghurs for instance, in China, that right now are being imprisoned and mistreated. And in North Korea, this president is elevating a dictator. We need to stop that, we need to return to ensuring that America leads again on human rights."
2019-09-12,Castro,"When it comes to this trade war, I would immediately begin ratcheting that trade war down. We have leverage in that discussion."
2019-09-12,Warren,"So our trade policy in America has been broken for decades and it has been broken because it works for giant multinational corporations and not for much of anyone else. These are giant corporations that, shoot, if they can save a nickel by moving a job to a foreign country, theyíll do it in a heartbeat. And yet, for decades now, whoís been whispering in the ears of our trade negotiators, who has shaped our trade policy? Itís been the giant corporations. Itís been their lobbyists and their executives."
2019-09-12,Warren,"The way we change our trade policy in America is first, the procedures, who sits at the table. I want to negotiate trade with unions at the table. I want to negotiate it with small farmers at the table. I want to negotiate with environmentalists at the table. I want to negotiate with human rights activists at the table."
2019-09-12,Warren,"And you ask the question about leverage, if I can just respond to that one. The leverage, are you kidding? Everybody wants access to the American market. That means that we have the capacity to say right here in America, ìYou want to come sell goods to American consumers? Then youíve got to raise your standards. Youíve got to raise your labor standards and youíve got to raise your environmental standards so our companies can compete on a level playing field.î We can use trade not to undermine American workers and not to undermine American farms and not to undermine small businesses in this country. We can use trade to help build a stronger economy."
2019-09-12,Harris,"Well, first of all, I have no criticism of that more than just looking at where we are now, which is that weíve got a guy in The White House who has been erratic on trade policy. He conducts trade policy by tweet, frankly born out of his fragile ego. It has resulted in farmers in Iowa with soy beans rotting in bins looking at bankruptcy. When we look at this issue, my trade policy under a Harris administration is always going to be about saying, ìWe need to export American products, not American jobs.î And to do that we have to have a meaningful trade policy. I am not a protectionist Democrat. Look, we need to sell our stuff, and that means we need to sell it to people overseas. That means we need trade policies that allow that to happen."
2019-09-12,Harris,"You asked earlier about China, itís a complicated relationship. We have to hold China accountable. They steal our products, including our intellectual property. They dump substandard products into our economy. They need to be held accountable."
2019-09-12,Harris,"We also need to partner with China on climate and the crisis that that presents. We need to partner with China on the issue of North Korea. I am on, and I think the only person on this stage, the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Homeland security committee. We need a partner on the issue of North Korea. But the bottom line is this, Donald Trump in office on trade policy, you know, he reminds me of that guy in the Wizard of Oz, you know, when you pull back the curtain itís a really small dude."
2019-09-12,Sanders,"There is a reason why in the last 45 years, the average American today, despite an explosion of technology and work or productivity, is not making a penny more than he or she made 45 years ago. And one of the reasons is that for decades we have had disastrous trade policies."
2019-09-12,Sanders,"And I got to say to my good friend Joe Biden, Joe and I strongly disagree on trade. I helped lead the opposition to NAFTA and PNTR, which cost this country over four million good paying jobs. And what happened is people who had those jobs ended up getting other jobs making 50% of what they made in manufacturing."
2019-09-12,Sanders,"So Trump obviously hasnít a clue. Trump thinks that trade policy is a tweet at three oíclock in the morning. What we have got to do is develop a trade policy that represents workers, represents the farmers in the Midwest and elsewhere. Weíre losing billions right now because of Trumpís policy. A trade policy which understands that if a company shuts down in America and goes abroad and then thinks theyíre going to get online to get a lucrative federal contract, under Bernie Sanders, they got another guess coming."
2019-09-12,Biden,"Yeah, well look, weíre either going to make the policy or Chinaís going to make the rules of the road. We make up 25% of the world economy. We need another 25% to join us, and I think Senator Warren is correct. At the table has to be labor, and at the table have to be environmentalists."
2019-09-12,Biden,"The fact of the matter is, China, the problem isnít the trade deficit. The problem is theyíre stealing our intellectual property. The problem is theyíre violating the WTO. Theyíre dumping steel on us. Thatís a different issue than whether or not theyíre dumping agricultural products on us."
2019-09-12,Biden,"In addition to that, weíre in a position where if we donít set the rules, we in fact are going to find ourselves with China setting the rules. And thatís why you need to organize the world to take on China to stop the corrupt practices that are underway."
2019-09-12,Booker,Sure.
2019-09-12,Booker,"Thereís one point weíre really missing on this stage right now, which is the fact that Donald Trumpís America First policy is actually an America isolated, an America alone policy. [crosstalk 00:12:26]."
2019-09-12,Booker,"From trade, to battling China, to the global crisis of climate change, the challenges in the Middle East. He is pulling us away from our allies, out of the Iran deal, out of the Paris climate accords. And on trade heís deciding to take on China while at the same time taking on tariff battles with all of our allies."
2019-09-12,Booker,"You literally have him using a national security waiver to put tariffs on Canada. Now look, Iím the only person on the stage that finds Trudeauís hair very menacing, but they are not a national security threat. We cannot go up against China alone. This is a president that has a better relationship with dictators like Duterte and Putin than he does with Merkel and Macron."
2019-09-12,Booker,"We are the strongest nation on the planet earth and our strength is multiplied and magnified when we stand with our allies in common cause and common purpose. Thatís how we beat China, thatís how we beat climate change on the planet earth and thatís how American values are the ones that lead on issues of trade and workersí rights."
2019-09-12,Warren,"Yes, and Iíll tell you why. What weíre doing right now in Afghanistan is not helping the safety and security of the United States, it is not helping the safety and security of the world, it is not helping the safety and security of Afghanistan. We need to bring our troops home and then we need to make a big shift. We cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily. Weíre not going to bomb our way to a solution in Afghanistan. We need to treat the problem of terrorism as a worldwide problem and that means we need to be working with all of our allies, our European allies, our Canadian allies, our Asian allies, our allies in Africa and in South America. We need to work together to root out terrorism. It means using all of our tools, it means economic investment, it means expanding our diplomatic efforts instead of hollowing out the state department and deliberately making it so we have no eyes and ears in many of these countries. We need a foreign policy that is about our security and about leading on our values."
2019-09-12,Warren,"I was in Afghanistan with John McCain two years ago this past summer. I think it may have been Senator McCainís last trip before he was sick. And I talked to people, we did, we talked to military leaders, American and local leaders. We talked to people on the ground and ask the question, the same one I ask on the Senate Armed Services Committee every time one of the Generals comes through. Show me what winning looks like, tell me what it looks like. And what you hear is a lot of [inaudible 00:16:22] because no one can describe it and the reason no one can describe it is because the problems in Afghanistan are not problems that can be solved by a military."
2019-09-12,Warren,"I have three older brothers who all served in the military. I understand firsthand the kind of commitment they have made. They will do anything we ask them to do, but we cannot ask them to solve problems that they alone cannot solve. We need to work with the rest of the world. We need to use our economic tools. We need to use our diplomatic tools, we need to build with our allies and we need to make the whole world safer, not keep troops bombing in Afghanistan."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"You know I served under General Dunford, way under General Dunford in Afghanistan. And today, September 12th, 2019 means that today you could be 18 years old, old enough to serve, and have not been alive on 9/11. We have got to put an end to endless war. And the way we do it is see to it that that country will never again be-"
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"Ö that that country will never again be used for an attack against our homeland, and that does not require an open-ended commitment of ground troops."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"Let me say something else, because if thereís one thing weíve learned about Afghanistan Ö from Afghanistan, itís that the best way not to be caught up in endless war is to avoid starting one in the first place. And so when I am president, an authorization for the use of military force will have a built-in three-year sunset. Congress will be required to vote and a president will be required to go to Congress to seek an authorization. Because if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas, the least our members of Congress should be able to do is summon the courage to take a vote on whether they ought to be there."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"By the way, we also have a president right now who seems to treat troops as props, or worse, tools for his own enrichment. We saw whatís going on with flights apparently being routed through Scotland just so people can stay at his hotels. Iíll tell you, as a military officer, the very first thing that goes through your mind the first time you ever make eye contact with somebody that you were responsible for in uniform is, ìDo not let these men and women down.î This president is doing exactly that. I will not."
2019-09-12,Biden,"No, it wasnít wrong to pull out, but I want to answer the Afghanistan question. Iíve been in and out of Afghanistan, not with a gun, and I admire my friend for his service, but Iíve been in and out of Afghanistan I think more than anybody on this Ö And itís an open secret. You reported a long time ago, George, that I was opposed to the surge in Afghanistan. The whole purpose of going to Afghanistan was to not have a counter insurgency, meaning that weíre going to put that country together. It can not be put together. Let me say it again, it will not be put together. Itís three different countries. Pakistan owns the three counties Ö the three provinces in the east. There are not any part of the [inaudible 00:20:37] run it. I will go on and on."
2019-09-12,Biden,"But hereís the point. The point is that itís a counter-terrorism strategy. We can prevent the United States from being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan by providing for bases, insist the Pakistanis provide bases for us to airlift from, and to move against what we know. We donít need those troops there. I would bring them home. And Joe Dunfordís a fine guy, but this has been an internal argument weíve had for eight years."
2019-09-12,Biden,"With regard to Iraq, the fact of the matter is that I shouldíve never voted to give Bush authority to go in and do what he said he was going to do. The AUMF was designed, he said, to go in and get the security council to vote 15 to nothing, to allow inspectors to go in to determine whether or not anything was being done with chemical weapons or nuclear weapons. And when that happened, he went ahead and went anyway without any of that proof."
2019-09-12,Biden,"I said something that was not meant the way I said it. I said from that point on what I was argued against in the beginning, once he started to put the troops in, was that, in fact, we were doing it the wrong way. There was no plan. We should not be engaged. We didnít have the people with us. We didnít have our aligned Ö We didnít have allies with us, etc. And it was later when we came into office, that Barack, the president, turned to me and said, ìJoe Öî when they said we got to plan to get out, he turned to the whole security, and said, ìJoe will organize this. Get the troops home.î"
2019-09-12,Biden,"My son spent a year in Iraq, and I understand, and we were right to get the combat troops out. The big mistake that was made, which we predicted, was that you would not have a circumstance where the Shia and the Kurds would work together to keep ISIS from moving in. Now-"
2019-09-12,Sanders,"David, let me answer that, but let me just comment on something that the vice president said. You talked about the big mistake in Iraq and the surge. The truth is, the big mistake, the huge mistake, and one of the big differences between you and me, I never believed what Cheney and Bush said about Iraq."
2019-09-12,Biden,Youíre right.
2019-09-12,Sanders,"I voted against the war in Iraq and helped lead the opposition. And itís sad to say, I mean, I kind of had the feeling that there would be massive destabilization in that area if we went into that war."
2019-09-12,Sanders,"As the former chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I want to pick up on what Pete said, we cannot express our gratitude to all of the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend us, who have responded to the call of duty. But I think also, I am the only person up here to have voted against all three of Trumpís military budgets. I donít think we have to spend $750 billion a year on the military when we donít even know who our enemy is."
2019-09-12,Sanders,"I think that what we have got to do is bring this world together, bring it together on climate change, bring it together in fighting against terrorism, and make it clear that we, as a planet, as a global community, weíll work together to help countries around the world rebuild their struggling economies, and do everything that we can to rid the world of terrorism. But dropping bombs on Afghanistan and Iraq was not the way to do it."
2019-09-12,Yang,"Iíve signed a pledge to end the forever wars. Weíve been in a state of continuous armed conflict for 18 years, which is not what the American people want. We have to start owning what we can and canít do. Weíre not very good at rebuilding countries. And if you want proof, all you have to do is look within our own country at Puerto Rico. Weíve spent trillions of dollars to unclear benefits, lost thousands of lives. And thank you, Pete, for your service."
2019-09-12,Yang,"And the goal has to be to rebuild the relationships that have made America strong for decades. I would lead our armed forces with restraint and judgment. What the American people want is simply a president who has the right values and point of view, and they can trust to make the right decisions when it comes to putting our young men and women into harmís way. And thatís what I would do as president."
2019-09-12,Sanders,"Well, first of all, let me be very clear. Anybody who does what Maduro does is a vicious tyrant. What we need now is international and regional cooperation for free elections in Venezuela so that the people of that country can make and can create their own future."
2019-09-12,Sanders,"In terms of democratic socialism, to equate what goes on in Venezuela with what I believe, is extremely unfair. Iíll tell you what I believe in terms of democratic socialism. I agree with what goes on in Canada and in Scandinavia, guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a human right. I believe that the United States should not be the only major country on earth not to provide paid family and medical leave. I believe that every worker in this country deserves a living wage, and that we expand the trade union movement."
2019-09-12,Sanders,"I happen to believe also that what, to me, democratic socialism means, is we deal with an issue we do not discuss enough, Jorge, not in the media, and not in Congress. You got three people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of this country. You got a handful of billionaires controlling what goes on in Wall Street, the insurance companies, and in the media. Maybe, just [inaudible 00:27:49] maybe, what we should be doing-"
2019-09-12,Sanders,"Ö is creating an economy that works for all of us, not 1%. Thatís my understanding of democratic socialism."
2019-09-12,Castro,"Sure. Thank you, Jorge. Iíll call Maduro a dictator, because he is a dictator. And what we need to do is to, along with our allies, make sure that the Venezuelan people get the assistance that they need, that we continue to pressure Venezuela so that theyíll have free and fair elections. And also, here in the United States, offer a temporary protected status, TPS, to Venezuelans. That is something that the Trump administration has failed to do. For all of his big talk about supporting the Venezuelan-American community, he has failed. I will not."
2019-09-12,Castro,"I also believe that we need to do things like a 21st-century Marshall Plan for Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to make the dangerous journey to the United States. And under my administration, weíre going to put renewed focus on Latin America. It makes sense. Theyíre our neighbors, and we have a lot of things in common."
2019-09-12,Castro,"It also makes sense that, because we have a country like China that is going around the world to places like Africa and Latin America, making their own relationships, strengthening those, the United States needs to strengthen its partnerships in Latin America immediately."
2019-09-12,Castro,And I will.
2019-09-12,Booker,"First of all, I want to say no. Actually, I want to translate that into Spanish: No. Look, letís just be clear, the factory farming going on thatís assaulting this corporate consolidation of the agriculture industry, one of the reasons why I have a bill to put a moratorium on this kind of corporate consolidation is because this factory farming is destroying and hurting our environment. And you see independent family farmers being pushed out of business because of the kind of incentives we are giving that donít line up with our values. Thatís what Iím calling for."
2019-09-12,Booker,"But I want to switch, because we donít have Ö a crowded debate stage. We were talking about Afghanistan and Iraq. It annoys me that we had a conversation about our troops overseas and we didnít say one word about veterans in our country. We have a shameful reality in America that we send people off to war and they often come home with invisible wounds, hurts and harms. Theyíre disproportionately homeless. You hear stories about women waiting for months for gynecological care through the VA. It is very important that we as a country understand that we are not going to solve every problem with this outrageous increased militarism, that we also make sure that we stand up for the people that stood for us. We end our national anthem with ìhome of the brave.î Itís about time we make this a better home for our bravest."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"Thank you. This is the existential crisis of our time. You know that movie, The Day After Tomorrow? Itís today. We have seen a warming in our world like never before. Weíre seeing flooding in the Midwest, flooding in Houston, fires in the West. And I think having someone leading the ticket from the Midwest will allow us to talk about this in a different way and get it done."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"On day one, I will get us back into the international climate change agreement. On day two, I will bring back the Clean Power rules that president Obama had worked on. On day three, I will bring back the gas mileage standards. You can do all that without Congress, which is good. On day four, five, and six, I will, working with Congress and mayors and businesspeople all over the country, introduce sweeping legislation to get at that 2050 goal."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"And on day seven, youíre supposed to rest, but I wonít."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,This is what we need to do if weíre going to get at climate change. We have to take this on as a crisis thatís happening right now.
2019-09-12,Warren,"Yes. We need to work on every front on climate change. It is the threat to every living thing on this planet, and we are running out of time. Every time the scientists go back, they say we have less and less time than we thought we had. But that means weíve got to use all the tools. One of the tools we need to use are our regulatory tools. I have proposed, following, Governor Inslee, that we, by 2028, cut all carbon emissions from new buildings, by 2030, carbon emissions from cars, and by 2035, all carbon emissions from the manufacture of electricity. That alone, those three, will cut our emissions here in the United States by 70%. We can do this."
2019-09-12,Warren,"We also need to help around the world to clean, but understand this one more time, why doesnít it happen?"
2019-09-12,Warren,"As long as Washington is paying more attention to money than it is to our future, we canít make the changes we need to make. We have to attack the corruption head on so that we can save our planet."
2019-09-12,Harris,"When I think about this issue, it really is through the lens of my baby nieces who are one and a half and three years old. When I look at what is going to be the world if we do nothing, when they turn 20, I am really scared. And when Iíve been in the United States Senate for now the last two and a half years, and I look at our counterparts, the Republicans in the United States Senate, they must be looking at their children. And then when they look at the mirror, I donít know what they see, but itís a lack of courage."
2019-09-12,Harris,"And this is an issue that, yes, it represents an existential threat. It is also something we can do something about. This is a problem that was created by human behaviors, and we can change our behaviors in a way that-"
2019-09-12,Harris,Ö and we can change our behaviors in a way that saves our planet. Iíve seen it happen in California. I took on as the Attorney General of California. I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States. Second only to the United States Department of Justice. I took on the big oil companies. We saw progress.
2019-09-12,Harris,"If any of you have been to Los Angeles [crosstalk 00:36:22] 20 years ago, youíll remember, that sky was brown. You go there now the sky is blue. You know why? Because leader decided to lead. We took on these big fossil fuel companies. We have some of the most important and strongest laws-"
2019-09-12,Harris,Ö in the country.
2019-09-12,Harris,We made a difference. My point being Iíve done it before and I will lead as president on this issue because we have no time. The clock is ticking-
2019-09-12,Harris,[crosstalk 00:36:48] Ö but we need courage and we need courageous leadership. We can get this done.
2019-09-12,Yang,"To follow up on what Elizabeth said, why are we losing to the fossil fuel companies? Why are we losing to the gun lobby and the NRA? The answer is this, we all know, everyone on this stage knows, that our government has been overrun by money and corporate interests. Now everyone here has a plan to try and curb those corporate interests, but we have to face facts. Money finds a way. Money will find its way back in."
2019-09-12,Yang,"What is the answer? The answer is to wash the money out with people powered money. My proposal is that we give every American 100 democracy dollars that you can only give to candidates and causes that you like. This would washout the lobbyist cash by a factor of eight to one. That is the only way we will win. As someone running for president Iíll tell you, thereís the people on one side and the money on the other. The only way for us to win is if we bring them together."
2019-09-12,Yang,"Let me be clear, I am pro good school. Iíve got a kid Ö One of my little boys just started public school last week, and I was not there because I was running for president. We need to pay teachers more because the data clearly shows a good teacher is worth his or her weight in gold. We need to lighten up the emphasis on standardized tests, which do not measure anything fundamental about our character or human word."
2019-09-12,Yang,"But hereís the big one, the data clearly shows that 65 to 70 percent of our studentsí outcomes are determined outside of the school. Weíre talking about time spent at home with the parents, words read to them when theyíre young, stress levels in the house, income, type of neighborhood. Weíre putting money into schools, and educators know this. Weíre saying, ìYouíre 100% responsible for educating our kids but you can only control 30%.î They all know this. The answer is to put money directly into the families and neighborhoods to give our kids a chance to learn, and our teachers a chance to teach."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"Step one is appoint a Secretary of Education who actually believes in public education. I believe in public education. In order to strengthen it some things are very complex, for preparing for a future where knowledge is at your fingertips but we got to teach more to do with critical thinking, and social and emotional learning. Some of it is extremely simple, weíve just got to pay teachers more. Weíve got to lift up the teaching profession."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"I always think of a story from South Bend of friends who hosted exchange students from Japan. They had a student one year who wanted to be a teacher. They kept in touch with her when she went back to Japan and to college. She took the exam to try to become a teacher, in a society that really regards teachers and compensates teachers well. She came up just short. You know what she did? Since she was academically good but couldnít quite make the cut to be a teacher? She had a fallback plan. She became a doctor. That is how seriously some countries treat the teaching profession."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,If we want to get the results that we expect for our children we have to support and compensate the teaching profession. Respect teachers the way we do soldiers and pay them more like the way we do doctors.
2019-09-12,Warren,"I think Iím the only person on this stage who has been a public school teacher. Iíve wanted to be a public school teacher since I was in 2nd grade. Letís be clear in all the ways we talk about this, money for public schools should stay in public schools, not go anywhere else. Iíve already made my commitment. We will have a Secretary of Education who has been a public school teacher."
2019-09-12,Warren,I think this is ultimately about our values. I have proposed a two cent wealth tax on the top 1/10 of 1% in this country. That would give us enough money to start with our babies by providing universal child care for every baby age zero to five. Universal pre-K for every three year old and four year old in this country.
2019-09-12,Warren,Raise the wages of every childcare worker and pre-school teacher in this country. Cancel student loan debt for 95% of the folks whoíve got it.
2019-09-12,Warren,"Strengthen our unions. This is how we build an America that reflects our values, not just where the money comes from with the billionaires and corporate executives."
2019-09-12,Harris,"My first grade teacher, Mrs. Francis Wilson, God rest her soul, attended my law school graduation. I think most of us would say that we are not where we are without the teachers who believed in us. I have offered, in this campaign, a proposal to deal with this, which will be the first in the nation, Federal investment enclosing the teacher pay gap. Which is $13,500 a year. Because right now in our public schools our teachers, 94% of them are coming out of their own pocket to help pay for school supplies. That is wrong."
2019-09-12,Harris,"I also want to talk about where we are here at TSU and what it means in terms of HBCUs. I have, as part of my proposal, that we will put two trillion dollars into investing in our HBCUs for teachers. Because one, as a proud graduate of a historically black college and university I will say that is our HBCUs that disproportionately produce teachers and those who serve in these many professions. But also-"
2019-09-12,Harris,But this is a critical point. If a black child has a black teacher before the end of third grade they are 13% more likely to go to college. If that child has had two black teachers before the end of third grade they are 32% more likely to go to college. When we talk about investing in our public education system it is at the source of so much. When we fix it that will fix so many other things. We must invest in the potential-
2019-09-12,Harris,Ö of our children.
2019-09-12,Harris,I strongly believe you can judge a [crosstalk 00:43:58] society based on how it treats its children and we are-
2019-09-12,Harris,Ö failing on this issue.
2019-09-12,Sanders,"Guess what? Youíre guessing. All right, hereís the answer. We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. Yet we have the highest child poverty rate of almost any country on Earth. We have teachers in this country who are leaving education because they canít work two or three jobs to support themselves, which is why under my legislation weíll move to see that every teacher in America makes at least $60,000 a year."
2019-09-12,Sanders,"What we will also do is not only have universal pre-K, we will make public colleges, and universities, and HBCUs debt free. What we will also do, because this is an incredible burden on millions and millions of young people who did nothing wrong except try to get the education they need, we are going to cancel all student debt in this country."
2019-09-12,Sanders,We are going to do that by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.
2019-09-12,Biden,"Well they have to deal with the Ö Look, there is institutional segregation in this country. From the time I got involved I started dealing with that. Redlining banks. Making sure that we are in a position where Ö Look, we talk about education. I propose that what we take is those very poor schools, the Title 1 schools, triple the amount of money we spend from 15 to 45 billion a year. Give every single teacher a raise so they equal raise of getting out of the $60,000 level."
2019-09-12,Biden,"Number two, make sure that we bring into help the teachers deal with the problems that come from home. The problems that come from home. We have one school psychologist for every 1,500 kids in America today. Itís crazy. The teachers are Ö Iím married to a teacher. My deceased wife is a teacher. They have every problem coming to them. We make sure that every single child does in fact have three, four, and five year olds go to school. School. Not daycare, school. We bring social workers into homes and parents, to help them deal with how to raise their children."
2019-09-12,Biden,Itís not that they donít want to help. They donít know quite what to do. Play the radio. Make sure the television Ö Excuse me. Make sure you have the record player on at night. Make sure the kids hear words. A kid coming from a very poor background will hear four million words fewer spoken by the time they get there. Thereís so much we can-
2019-09-12,Biden,"No, Iím going to go like the rest of them do, twice over. Okay? Because hereís the deal. The deal is that weíve got this a little backwards."
2019-09-12,Biden,"By the way, in Venezuela we should be allowing people to come here from Venezuela. I know Maduro. Iíve confronted Maduro."
2019-09-12,Biden,"Number two, you talk about the need to do something to Latin America. Iím the guy that came up with 740 million dollars to see to it those three countries, in fact, changed their system so people donít have a chance to leave. Youíre all acting like we just discovered this yesterday. Thank you very much."
2019-09-12,Castro,"Thank you very much. Well thatís quite a lot. [crosstalk 00:48:05] But I grew up in one of those neighborhoods that folks have talked about. In a neighborhood that was grappling with the legacy of segregation. In fact in two public school districts that were involved in a 1973 Supreme Court case, challenging how Texas financed its schools."
2019-09-12,Castro,"I know that today our schools are segregated because our neighborhoods are segregated. Now I have an education plan, like a lot of folks up here, that would pay teachers more. That would recruit diverse ranks of teachers. That would invest in our public schools, but I also believe that we have to connect the dots. To uplift the quality of life. To invest in housing opportunity, to invest in job opportunity, to invest in community schools that offer resources like parents able to go back and get their GED. Healthcare opportunities. Those things that truly ensure that the entire family can prosper. Those are the types of things we need to do, in addition to lifting up our public schools."
2019-09-12,Castro,"You asked a second ago about charter schools. Look, it is a myth that charter schools are better than public schools. Theyíre not."
2019-09-12,Castro,"Well Iím not categorically against charter schools, I would require more transparency and accountability from them than is required right now."
2019-09-12,Booker,"Iím hearing a lot of conversations on the stage and the way we talk about communities of color. Look I live in a black and brown community below the poverty line. Iíve lived in [Polk 00:50:10] Housing Projects for almost a decade and saw the anguish of parents who are just so deeply frustrated that they donít have a school that serves their genius. I think Iím the only person on the stage, even though I had no formal authority as Mayor to run a school system, I stepped up and took responsibility for our schools. We produce results."
2019-09-12,Booker,"A lot of folks here talking about raising teachers salary. We actually did it in Newark, New Jersey. We didnít stop there. We closed poor performing charter schools, but dagnabbit we expanded high performing charter schools. We were a city that said, ìWe need to find local solutions that work for our community.î The results speak for themselves. Weíre now the number one city in America for Beat the Odds schools. From high poverty to high performance. Strategies like investing in our children work."
2019-09-12,Booker,"Iíll tell you this. I am tired of us thinking about these problems isolated, disconnected from the other issues. Thatís why my friend Secretary Castro is 100% right. We are in the reality we are right now because Vice President of overtly racist policies, not 400 years ago just in my lifetime. That were redlining communities, disinvesting in communities. More than just that, my kids are not only struggling with racial segregation, and housing, and the challenges of underfunded schools, but theyíre also struggling with environmental injustice. If youíve talked to someone whoís a parent of a child who has had permanent brain damage because of lead, youíll know this is a national problem because thereís over 3,000 jurisdictions in America where children have more than twice the blood lead levels of Flint, Michigan."
2019-09-12,Booker,"If Iím President of the United States it is a holistic solution to education. From raising teachersí salary, fully funded special education, but combating the issues of poverty, combating the issues of racial segregation, combating the issues of a criminal justice system that takes-"
2019-09-12,Booker,Ö parents away from their kids. Dealing with environmental justice as a major pillar of any climate policy.
2019-09-12,Biden,"I never counted any professional setback I have as a serious setback. Thereís things that are important, things that arenít important."
2019-09-12,Biden,Whatíd they say?
2019-09-12,Biden,Iím sorry.
2019-09-12,Biden,"There are setbacks to the setbacks, and I think the most critical setback that can occur to anyone is to lose Ö Well, my dad had an expression. He said, ìJoey, itís not a question of succeeding and whether you get knocked down, itís how quickly you get up.î He used to say, ìYou never explain and never complain.î Then go on to say that, ìThe only obligation that really matters, the most important thing is family.î"
2019-09-12,Biden,"So, I was raised to believe that that was the center of everything, family, and could be judged on based how you treat your family and how you went from there. It took Ö you know, Kierkegaard said, ìFaith sees best in the dark.î"
2019-09-12,Biden,"Right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, and my two sons were badly injured. Iíd just been elected, not sworn in. I lost my faith for awhile. I came back. Then later when my son Beau came home from Iraq and with a terminal disease and a year later, a year and a half later, losing him was like losing part of my soul. The fact is that I learned that the way you deal with it is you deal with finding purpose, purpose in what you do."
2019-09-12,Biden,"Thatís why I hope heís proud of me today because he wanted to make sure I didnít run for president but I stayed engaged. Because when you get hit badly, whether youíre losing a job or youíre raising a family, like my dad, where you have to make that longest walk up the stairs to tell your kid, ìYou canít live here anymore.î Dad lost his job. You know, weíve all been through that some form or another. It just takes Ö just for me, the way Iíve dealt with it is finding purpose. My purpose is to do what Iíve always tried to do and stay engaged in public policy."
2019-09-12,Biden,"Thereís a lot of people who went through a lot worse than I have and get up every single morning, put their feet one foot in front of another without the help I had. There are real heroes out there, some real heroes."
2019-09-12,Warren,"I mentioned earlier, Iíve known what I wanted to be since second grade. I wanted to be a public school teacher, and I invested early. I used to line my dollies up and teach school. I had a reputation for being tough but fair. By the time I graduated from high school, my family didnít have money for a college application, much less to send me off to four years at a university."
2019-09-12,Warren,"My story, like a lot of stories, has a lot of twists and turns. I got a scholarship. Then at 19, I got married, dropped out of school, took a minimum wage job, thought my dream was over. I got a chance down the road at the university of Houston, and I made it as a special needs teacher. I still remember that first year as a special needs teacher. I could tell you what those babies looked like. I had four to six year olds."
2019-09-12,Warren,"At the end of that first year I was visibly pregnant. Back in the day, that meant that the principal said to me Ö wished me luck and hired someone else for the job. So, there I am. Iím at home, Iíve got a baby, I canít have a job. What am I going to do? Hereís resilience. I said, ìIíll go to law school.î The consequence was, I practiced law for about 45 minutes and then went back to my first love, which is teaching. It let me get into fights. It gave me new tools. The reason Iím standing here today is because I got back up. I fought back. I know whatís broken. I want to be in the fight to fix it in America."
2019-09-12,Warren,Thatís why Iím here.
2019-09-12,Sanders,"Iíd say that resilience to me means growing up in a rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York, the son of an immigrant who came to this country without a nickel in his pocket. Professional resilience means to me, George, running for US Senate in Vermont and getting one percent of the vote, running for governor and getting two percent of the vote. Finally, becoming mayor of Burlington, Vermont with ten vote margin."
2019-09-12,Sanders,"What resilience means to me is that throughout my political career, I have taken on virtually every powerful special interest in this country, whether it is Wall Street, whether it is the insurance industry, whether it is the pharmaceutical industry whose corruption and greed is killing people today, whether it is a military industrial complex or a prison industrial complex. I feel confident that given a lifelong record Iíve taken on powerful special interests of standing up for the working families of this country, that I will be able to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and create a government and an economy that works for all of us. Not just the one percent."
2019-09-12,Harris,"Every office Iíve run for, whether it be district attorney or attorney general, I was told each time it canít be done. They said, ìNobody like you has done it before. Youíre Ö nobody is ready for you.î When I ran for DA, I won and became the first Black woman elected DA in a state of 40 million people in San Francisco. When I ran for Attorney General of California, I was elected because I didnít listen. I was the only Black elected woman, Black elected attorney general in the state, in the country."
2019-09-12,Harris,"Each time people would say, ìItís not your time. Itís not your turn. Itís going to be too difficult. Theyíre not ready for you.î I didnít listen. A part of it probably comes from the fact that I was raised by a mother who said many things that were life lessons for me, including, ìDonít you ever let anybody tell you who you are. You tell them who you are.î"
2019-09-12,Harris,"When I look around the town halls that we do in this race for President of the United States and I look at the meetings that we do and the community meetings and I see these little girls and boys sometimes even brought by their fathers. They bring them to me, and I talk to them during these events and they smile. Theyíre full of joy and their fathers tell them, ìSee, donít you ever listen and let anybody ever tell you what you can or cannot be. You have to believe in what can be unburdened by what has been.î"
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"As a military officer serving under, ìDonít Ask, Donít Tell,î and as an elected official in the State of Indiana when Mike Pence was governor, at a certain point when it came to professional setbacks, I had to wonder whether just acknowledging who I was was going to be the ultimate career ending professional setback. I came back from deployment and realized that you only get to live one life, and I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer. So, I just came out. I had no idea what kind of professional setback it would be, especially because inconveniently it was an election year in my socially Conservative community."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"What happened was that when I trusted voters to judge me based on the job that I did for them, they decided to trust me and reelected me with 80% of the vote. What I learned was that trust can be reciprocated and that part of how you can win and deserve to win is to know whatís worth more to you than winning. I think thatís what we need in the presidency right now. We have to know what we are about."
2019-09-12,Buttigieg,"This election is not about any of us up here. It is not about this President, even though itís hard to talk of anything else some days. Itís about the people who trust us with their lives. A kid wondering if weíre actually going to make their schools safe when theyíve learned active shooter drills before theyíve learned to read, a generation wondering whether we will actually get the job done on climate change. If we hold to that, then it doesnít matter what happens to each of us professionally. Together we will win a better era for our country."
2019-09-12,Yang,"I was an unhappy lawyer for five whole months, and I left to start a business. Iím going to share with you all one of the secrets to entrepreneurship. If you want to start something, tell everyone you know youíre going to do it. Then you donít have a choice. You put your heart and soul into it. Even though I did that, my company flopped, had its mini rise and maximum fall, lost investors, hundreds of thousands of dollars. Still owed 100,000 in school debt. My parents still told people I was a lawyer. I guess it was a little easier."
2019-09-12,Yang,"So, I remember lying on my floor, looking up, wondering how did it come to this, Eventually, I picked myself back up. I kept working in small growth companies for another ten years and eventually had some success. Then after I did have some success, I still remembered how hard it was, how isolating it was, how it feels like your friends no longer want to spend time with you. So, I spent seven years starting and running a nonprofit that helped train young entrepreneurs around the country, including Sean Wen, whoís here in the audience tonight who left his gilded Wall Street job to become a food entrepreneur in San Antonio. Sean, I hope I made the process a little bit easier for you than it was for me. The goal of my campaign is to make this an economy that allows us to live our human values and aspirations."
2019-09-12,Booker,"My biggest professional setback is embarrassing, because a lot of folks know about it. I, with a bunch of tenant leaders in Newark, New Jersey in 2002, took on the political machine. Boy, did they fight back. I had tires on my car slashed. Our campaign offices were broken into. My phones were tapped. It became a spectacle, and we lost that election. Hereís a bit of advice to everybody. If youíre going to have a spectacular failure, have a documentary team there to capture it because it made for an Oscar nominated documentary called Street Fight. But hen unfortunately, another setback, it lost in the Oscars to a movie called March of the dag nab Penguins, for crying out loud."
2019-09-12,Booker,"The people in my community of living in the projects told me, ìDonít give up on the people, and the people wonít give up on you. Create bigger and bolder coalitions, and youíre going to win.î You know what? We came back four years later and won the largest lopsided victory in our cityís history."
2019-09-12,Booker,"More than that, the lesson was there. We didnít give up. We were taking on Americaís toughest problems from crime to poverty. We transformed our city, creating tens of thousands of new jobs, the biggest economic expansion in our city, and as I said before, turned around our school system. Thereís more work to do, but I havenít given up on the people. I still live in that community."
2019-09-12,Booker,"This is the big lesson. My staff and my friends and my community told me, ìIf you want to go fast, you may have won the mayorís race, but thatís not what life is about.î Thereís an old African saying that says, ìIf you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want to go far, go together.î The lesson I learned of resilience is to trust people, because the power of the people is always greater than the people in power. The test of America right now, itís not a referendum on Donald Trump. Itís a referendum on us and who we are and who weíre going to be together. We need to use this moment in history to unite in common cause and common purpose, and then thereís nothing we canít do together as a nation."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"My challenges and resilience have brought me up here. I grew up with a dad who struggled with alcoholism his whole life. After his third DWI, he had a choice between jail and treatment. He chose treatment with his faith, with his friends, with our family. In his words, he was pursued by grace. That made me interested in public service, because I feel like everyone should have that same right to be pursued by grace. Then got married. My husbandís out there somewhere, hopefully smiling, and our daughter. Our daughter was born, I had this expectation, we were going to have this perfect, perfect birth. She was really sick, and she couldnít swallow. She was in and out of hospitals for a year and a half. But when she was born, they had a rule in place that you got kicked out of the hospital in 24 hours. She was in intensive care, and I was kicked out. I thought this could never happen to any other mom again."
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"So, I went to the legislature, our state legislator, not an elected official, a mom, and I advocated for one of the first laws in the country guaranteeing new moms and their babies a 48 hour hospital stay. When they tried to delay the implementation of that law, I brought six pregnant friends to the conference committee so they outnumbered the lobbyist two to one. When they said, ìWhen should it take place?î, they all raised their hand and said, ìNow.î"
2019-09-12,Klobuchar,"That is what motivated me to go into public service. When I got to that gridlock of Washington DC and got to work and pass over a hundred bills Ö I know a lot of my friends here are from the Left, but remember I am from the middle of the country. I believe if weíre going to get things done that we have to have someone leading the ticket with grit. Someoneís going to not just change the policies but change the tone in the country and someone who believes in America and believes it from their heart because of where they came from, that everyone should have that same opportunity."
2019-09-12,Castro,"Thank you, George, to hold head to Linsey and to David and to all of you all for tuning in tonight. In many ways, I shouldnít be here on this stage. Castro is my motherís name and was my grandmotherís name before her. I grew up in a single parent household on the West side of San Antonio going to the public schools. Eventually my brother, Joaquin, and I became the first in our family to become professionals."
2019-09-12,Castro,"When I got home, I took a job at the biggest law firm in town. I was making $100,000 a year in the year 2000. A few months later, I got elected to the San Antonio City Council. The city council at the time was only paying $1,040 a year. So, everybody had another job, and my job was at the law firm. Well, a few months after I got elected, the law firm got a client. The client wanted those of us on the city council to vote for a land deal. The land deal was that they wanted to build a golf course over our water supply, because we relied on an underground aquifer. I didnít think the environmental protection plan was strong enough, so I wanted to vote against it and my constituents wanted me to vote against it. But under the ethics rules for lawyers in Texas, because believe it or not, lawyers have ethics rules, you canít just go against the interests of a client. So, I was stuck."
2019-09-12,Castro,"On the one hand, I wanted to do the right thing. On the other hand, my livelihood, my student loans, my new house payment, my car payment depended on me shutting up, being conflicted out. So, one day I walked into my law firm and I quit my job and then I went and I voted against that land deal on the city council."
2019-09-12,Castro,"It was the first test that I had. I think back to that because oftentimes we think of politics and you think of politics is dirty or corrupting. I wondered before I went into it whether it would change who I was. I was proud that when that first test came that I stood up for the people that I was there to represent and not for big special interests. Thereís nobody that gets tested more in a position of public trust than the President of the United States. This President has failed that test, but I want you to know that if you elect me president, I wonít. I wonít serve anybody except you and your family. Together we can create an America thatís better than ever. Thank you very much."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"To the working people of America, tonight I bring you a message of hope. We can make change in this country. I know from personal experience it can be done. When I became the mayor of the nationís largest city, I set us on a path of bold change. They said it couldnít be done, but we gave pre-K to every child for free. We got rid of Stop and Frisk and we lowered crime. We raise the minimum wage to $15.00 an hour, yes, it can be done. Now tonight we have to get to the heart and soul of who we are as Democrats. There are good people on this stage, but there are real differences. Joe Biden told wealthy donors that nothing fundamentally would change if he were president."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"Kamala Harris said sheís not trying to restructure society. Well, I am. For 40 years, working people have taken it on the chin in this country. For 40 years, the rich and gotten richer and they paid less and less in taxes. It cannot go on this way. When I am president, we will even up the score and we will tax the hell out of the wealthy to make this a fairer country and to make sure itís a country that puts working people first."
2019-07-31,Bennet,"Thank you. Last week I saw one of those Trump signs that says ìAmerica, love it or leave itî and it was on the outside of the church. I love America and I know we can make it better. Before coming to the Senate, I ran a large urban school district where most of the kids live in poverty. Those kids have exactly the same hopes that I had. Their parents have exactly the same hopes for them that my parents had for me. And that Susan and I had for our three children. But for the last three years weíve been consumed by a president who frankly doesnít give a damn about your kids or mine. Mr. President, kids belong in classrooms, not cages. And they deserve something better than a bully in the White House. Letís end this three ring circus in Washington and letís make this election about reclaiming our future for our kids and our democracy. Empty promises wonít beat Donald Trump, I can."
2019-07-31,Inslee,"Good evening, Iím Jay Inslee. I am running for president because the people in this room and the Democrats watching tonight are the last best hope for humanity on this planet. If we make defeating the climate crisis the top priority of the United States, we will have a fighting chance to save ourselves and our childrenís future. It has to be our top priority. My plan is one of national mobilization, quickly bringing 100% clean energy to Americans, creating eight million good union jobs. This is a big, bold, ambitious plan for clean energy for a big, bold, ambitious nation. Middle ground approaches are not enough. We must confront the fossil fuel industry. Iíve been working on this for 25 years and now we know this, weíre a tipping point. And whether we shrink from this challenge or rise to it is the vital question of our time. We Democrats believe we can still do big things in this nation. We can defeat the climate crisis. Letís get to work."
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"My grandmother taught me that nothingís impossible. She spent two generations organizing women in upstate New York. My mother taught me nothingís impossible. She was one of my only three women in her law school class and worked with gay couples for basic rights. If you want to get something done just tell me itís impossible. As a freshman senator, I was told you couldnít repeal donít ask, donít tell. Even numbers of my own party told me it wasnít convenient. When are civil rights ever convenient? We stood up to the Pentagon and we got it done, not impossible. 10 years ago, I was told you couldnít pass healthcare for our 9/11 first responders. Those heroes who raced up the towers when others were coming down. Even when Congress turned its back on them, we kept fighting. Just last week we made the 9/11 health bill permanent. Beating Donald Trump, definitely not impossible. We need a nominee who will take on the big fights and win. We need a nominee who doesnít know the meaning of impossible."
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"I love our country. Itís why I enlisted after 9/11 where Iíve served as a soldier for over 16 years, deployed twice to the Middle East and serve in Congress now for almost seven years. I know what patriotism is and Iíve known many great patriots throughout my life. And let me tell you this, Donald Trump is not behaving like a patriot. As president, I will bring this spirit of real patriotism to the White House, serving the interest of all Americans, not just the rich and powerful. Iíll fight for our rights and freedoms of all Americans upholding these principles in our constitution upon which our country was founded. Fighting for justice and equality for all. Fighting for every single American, regardless of race or religion as we strive towards that more perfect union. And as president, Iíll bring this unifying spirit of love for country and the soldiers values of service above self to the White House, truly leading a government of, by and for the people."
2019-07-31,Castro,"Thank you Dana and good evening. Just a few days ago we were reminded and inspired by our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico. That public service is not fundamentally about any of us. Itís about you and your family. I want you to know that if Iím elected president, that I will work hard every single day so that you and your family can have good healthcare when you need it. So that your children and grandchildren can get a good education so that they can reach their dreams, and then you can have good job opportunities. Whether you live here in a big city like Detroit or in a small town in our country. I know we have a wonderful, special nation but that too many people are struggling and I know what thatís like too. I grew up with a single mom in a poor neighborhood. But like many of you, I donít want to make America anything again. I donít want us to go backwards. Weíre not going back to the past. Weíre not going back where we came from. Weíre going to move forward. Weíre going to make America better than itís ever been in the years to come. Letís do that together."
2019-07-31,Yang,"If you heard anything about me and my campaign, youíve heard that someone is running for president who wants to give every American $1,000 a month. I know this may sound like a gimmick but this is a deeply American idea. From Thomas Payne to Martin Luther King to today. Let me tell you why we need to do it and how we pay for it. Why do we need to do it? We already automated away millions of manufacturing jobs and chances are your job could be next. If you donít believe me, just ask an auto worker here in Detroit. How do we pay for it? Raise your hand in the crowd if youíve seen stores closing where you live. It is not just you, Amazon is closing 30% of Americaís stores and malls and paying zero in taxes while doing it. We need to do the opposite of much of what weíre doing right now. And the opposite of Donald Trump is an Asian man who likes math. So let me share the math. On $1,000 a month for every adult would be $461 million every month right here in Detroit alone. The automation of our jobs is a central challenge facing us today. It is why Donald Trump is our president and any politician not addressing it is failing the American people."
2019-07-31,Booker,"Thank you Dana. Last week, the President of the United States attacked an American city calling it a disgusting, rat infested rodent mess. We need a nation that understands that these tired old language-"
2019-07-31,Booker,I will stand by.
2019-07-31,Booker,"Thank you very much. Donald Trump from Charleston to Baltimore to even the border is using the tired old language of demagogues, of fear-mongers, of racists to try to divide our country against itself. We know who Donald Trump is but in this election the question is who are we as a people? We have serious problems in America. We have deep wounds and seriously, deeply rooted challenges. We desperately need to heal as a nation and move forward. Because we know in this country that our fates are united, that we have a common destiny. The call of this election is the call to unite in common cause and common purpose. Thatís how we will beat Donald Trump. Thatís how I will beat Donald Trump and as your president, thatís how I will govern and move us forward together."
2019-07-31,Harris,"This is an inflection moment in the history of our country, I think we all know that. This is a moment in time that is requiring us each as individuals and collectively to look in a mirror and ask the question, that question being, who are we? And I think most of us know that part of the answer to that question is we are better than this. So this then becomes a moment that we must fight for the best of who we are and fight of course we will. And this is not a new fight for us as Americans. We have always been prepared to fight for our ideals. We have always been a nation that fights for the best of who we are. And Iíll tell you, I come from fighters. My parents met when they were active in the civil rights movement. My sister Maya and I joke, we grew up surrounded by a bunch of adults, who spent full time marching and shouting about this thing called justice. And I am prepared to march with you, to fight with you for the best of who we are and to successfully prosecute the case of four more years of Donald Trump and against him."
2019-07-31,Biden,"Tonight I think Democrats are expecting some engagement here and I expect weíll get it. Iím running for president to restore the soul of this country. We have a president, as everybodyís acknowledged here, every day is ripping at the social fabric of this country. But no one man has the capacity to rip that apart, itís too strong, weíre too good. Just look at this stage made up of very diverse people from diverse backgrounds. Went on to be mayors, senators, governors, congresswomen, members of the cabinet and yes, even a vice president. Mr. President, this is America and we are stronger and great because of this diversity, Mr. President. Not in spite of it, Mr. President. So Mr. President, letís get something straight. We love it, we are not leaving it. We are here to stay and weíre certainly not going to leave it to you."
2019-07-31,Harris,"Well, theyíre probably confused because theyíve not read it, but the reality is that I have been spending time in this campaign listening to American families. Listening to experts, listening to healthcare providers and what I came away with is a very clear understanding that I needed to create a plan that was responsive to the needs of the American people. Responsive to their needs, understanding that insurance companies have been jacking up the prices for far too long. That American families have to be held down by deductibles and copays and premiums that can cause them bankruptcy."
2019-07-31,Harris,"I listened to the American families who said four years is just not enough to transition into this new plan. So I devised a plan where itís going to be 10 years of a transition. I listened to American families who said, I want an option that will be under your Medicare system that allows a private plan. So I designed a plan where yes, responsive to the needs of American families, there will be a public plan under my plan for Medicare and a private plan under my plan for Medicare. Because the bottom line is this, we must agree that access to healthcare must be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. And in America today, far too many people, in fact, 30 million people are going without access to healthcare."
2019-07-31,Biden,"Well my response is that is the Senatorís had several plans so far. And anytime someone tells you youíre going to get something good in 10 years, you should wonder why it takes 10 years. If you noticed thereís no talk about the fact that the plan in 10 years will cost $3 trillion. You will lose your employer based insurance. And in fact, this is the single most important issue facing the public. And to be very blunt and to be very straightforward, you canít beat President Trump with double talk on this plan."
2019-07-31,Harris,"Absolutely. Unfortunately, Vice President Biden, youíre just simply inaccurate in what youíre describing. The reality is that our plan will bring healthcare to all Americans under a Medicare For All system. Our plan will allow people to start signing up on the first day. Babies will be born into our plan and right now four million babies almost are born every day in America or every year in America. Under our plan, we will ensure that everyone has access to healthcare. Your plan by contrast, leaves out almost 10 million Americans. So I think that you should really think about what youíre saying, but be reflective and understand that the people of America want access to healthcare and do not want costs to be their barrier to getting it."
2019-07-31,Biden,"The plan, no matter how you cut it cost $3 trillion when it is in fact employed. Number one, 10 years from now after two terms of the senator being president, after her time. Secondly, it will require middle-class taxes to go up, not down. Thirdly, it will eliminate employer based insurance and fourthly, what happens in the meantime?"
2019-07-31,Harris,"Iíd like to respond. First of all, the cost of doing nothing is far too expensive. Second, we are now paying $3 trillion a year for healthcare in America. Over the next 10 years, itís probably going to be $6 trillion. We must act. My plan is about immediately allowing people to sign up and get into coverage. Right now in America, we have seniors who everyday, millions of seniors are going into the Medicare system and they are getting full coverage and the kind of coverage they need. All people should have access to healthcare and and costs should not be-"
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"Thank you. I donít know what the Vice President or Senator are talking about. The folks I talked to about health insurance say that their health insurance isnít working for them. Thereís tens of millions of Americans who donít even have health insurance, tens of millions more who have health insurance they can barely make work because of the copays, the deductibles, the premiums, the out-of-pocket expenses. Thereís this mythology that somehow all these folks are in love with their insurance in America. What I hear from union members and from hardworking, middle-class people is, they wish they had better insurance."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"From hard-working middle class people is, they wish they had better insurance and theyíre angry at private insurance companies that skim all the profits off the top and make it impossible for everyday people to get coverage like mental health care, dental care-"
2019-07-31,de Blasio,The things that would be full coverage for all Americans.
2019-07-31,Biden,"My response is Obamacare is working. The way to build this and get to it immediately is to build on Obamacare. Go back and doÖ take back all the things that Trump took away, provide a public option, meaning every single person in America would be able to buy into the option if they didnít like their employer plan or if theyíre on Medicaid, theyíd automatically be in the plan. It would be taking place immediately, it would move quickly, and it would insure the vast, vast, vast majority of Americans."
2019-07-31,Biden,"In the mean time, what happens? Did anybody tell you how much their plans cost? My plans cost $750 billion dollars. Thatís what it costs. Not $30 trillion dollars."
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"I think for the viewers in the audience right now, theyíre at risk of losing the forest through the trees. Because the truth is, healthcare in America should be a right. When I was a young mother and had Theo as an infant, he had an allergic reaction to eggs and his whole body turned red and puffy. I had to rush him to the emergency room. My heart is palpitating, because Iím worried that his throat will close. I am not worried about not having an insurance card, or a credit card in my wallet. I know whatever theyíre going to prescribe, whether itís an EpiPen or an inhaler, I can afford it. The truth about healthcare in America today is people canít afford it. They cannot afford, and these insurance companies, for these plans that rely on insurance companies, Iím sorry."
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"Theyíre for profit companies. They have an obligation to their shareholders. They pay their CEO millions of dollars. They have to have quarterly profits. They have fat in the system thatís real and it should be going to healthcare. So letís not lose the forest through the trees and last, letís not forget what the Republicans are doing. Because the truth is, the Republicans and Trump, their whole goal is to take away your healthcare."
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"To make it harder for you to afford it, even if you have a pre-existing condition."
2019-07-31,Harris,"In response to Senator Biden about the Affordable Care Act, it is important that you understand that our Medicare for All plan has actually by the architect of the Obama Affordable Care Act been described as one of the most effective way to bring healthcare to all, Kathleen Sibelius has endorsed our plan as being something that will get us to where we need to go. In terms of the point that Senator Gillibrand is raising, I couldnít agree more. Senator Biden, your plan will keep and allow insurance companies to remain with status quo, doing business as usual. And thatís going to be about jacking up copays, jacking up deductibles-"
2019-07-31,Harris,It will still be the situation-
2019-07-31,Harris,"That people going to an emergency room have to come out $5,000."
2019-07-31,Biden,"My plan makes a limit of copay to be $1,000, because we further support the ability to buy in to the Obamacare plan. Secondly, the idea that this is somehow a bad idea, no one has to keep their private insurance, but if they like their insurance, they should be able to keep it. Nothing is demanded in my plan that there be private insurance, it says, ìIf the 160 million people who have it say they like their employer insurance, they should have a right to have it. If they donít, they can buy in to the Biden plan which is Obamacare with a,î-"
2019-07-31,Booker,"Well, first of all, let me just say that the person thatís enjoying this debate most right now is Donald Trump, as we pit Democrats against each other while he is working right now to take away Americansí healthcare. Thereís a court case working through the system thatís going to gut the Affordable Care Act and actually gut protections on pre-existing conditions. And so I was raised by two Civil Rights parents who told me to always keep your eyes on the prize and that is that the United States of America, every Democrat should stand with the belief that everyone should have access to healthcare. That itís a human right. And how we get there, it has to be to end this broken system, because we are on our way in just a handful of years, of literally spending 20% of our economy, one out of every $5 spent on healthcare."
2019-07-31,Booker,"And we spend more than every other nation, on everything from MRIs to insulin drugs, multiple more than other countries. And so you want to know what Iím going to do? Iím going to work to get us to a point where Medicare for all, where everyone is covered. But this pitting against progressives against moderates, saying one is unrealistic and the other doesnít care enough, that to me is dividing our party and demoralizing us in the face of the real enemy here."
2019-07-31,Booker,[crosstalk 00:24:31] And Iím going to keep fighting for that.
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"The reality is right now, we donít have a healthcare system. We have a sick care system, and there are far too many people in this country who are sick and unable to get the care that they need because they cannot afford it. So the core of this problem is the fact that big insurance companies and big pharmaceutical companies whoíve been profiting off the backs of sick people have had a seat at the table writing this legislation. Now, Kamala Harris just talked about Kathleen Sibelius who helped write her bill. This just pointed to the fatal flaw in her proposal."
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"Sibelius works for Medicare Advantage, private insurance company who will stand to profit under her plan. If weíre seeking to really reform our healthcare system, weíve got to shut out big insurance and big pharma, out of the drafting process so that they cannot continue to profit off the backs of the sick people in this country who are searching and in desperate need of care."
2019-07-31,Harris,"Well, unfortunately Representative Gabbard got it wrong. Kathleen Sibelius did not write my plan, she endorsed it as being one of the plans that is the best to get us to a place where everyoneís going to have access to healthcare in America. And when we talk about this again, Iím going to go back to Vice President Biden, because your plan does not cover everyone in America, by your staffís and your own definition. 10 million people, as many as 10 million people will not have access to healthcare. And in 2019 in America, for a Democrat to be running for President with a plan that does not cover everyone, I think is without excuse."
2019-07-31,Harris,Our plan covers everyone-
2019-07-31,Harris,And gives people choice.
2019-07-31,Biden,"My plan will cover everyone, number one. Number two, the fact is that my plan also calls for controlling drug prices. The bio pharma is now where things are going to go, itís no longer chemicals, itís about all these breakthroughs we have with generally the whole, excuse me, immune system. And what we have to do now is we have to have a form that sits in the HHS and says, ìAs you develop a drug, youíve got to come to us and decide what you can sell it for. We will set the price.î And secondly, it says that you cannot raise that price beyond the cost of inflation from this point on-"
2019-07-31,Biden,[crosstalk 00:26:55] To end the-
2019-07-31,Bennet,"I agree that it makes it much more likely. Unlike others on this stage, Iíve been crystal clear of where Iíve been for a decade, through two tough races in Colorado. I believe we should finish the job we started with the Affordable Care Act with a public option that gives everybody in this audience the chance to pick for their family whether they want private insurance or public insurance."
2019-07-31,Bennet,"It requires drug companies to be negotiated with by Medicare, and it provides competition. That is totally different from the plan that Senator Warren and Senator Sanders and Senator Harris have proposed, which would make illegal employer-based health insurance in this country, and massively raise taxes on the middle class, to the tune of $30 trillion dollars, as Joe Biden said. We donít need to do that. It doesnít make sense for us to take away insurance from half the people in this room and put huge taxes on almost everybody in this room, when we can pass a public option. Trust the American people to make the right decision and have universal healthcare in this country, in two years. Not 10 years."
2019-07-31,Harris,I need to respond.
2019-07-31,Castro,"Well, I know that this is something very personal for all Americans. I grew up with a grandmother that had diabetes, and I watched as her condition got worse and worse. That whole time, she had Medicare. I want to strengthen Medicare for the people who are on it, and then expand it to anybody who wants it. I also believe though that if somebody has a private health insurance plan that is strong, that they want to hold onto, that they should be able to do that. What I donít believe is that the profit motive of big pharma or big insurance companies should ever determine in our great nation, whether somebody gets healthcare or not."
2019-07-31,Harris,"Well, first of all with all due respect to my friend Michael Bennet, my plan does not offer anything that is illegal. What it does is it separates the employer from healthcare, meaning that where you work will not be a, the kind of healthcare you get will not be a function of where you work. I have met so many Americans who stick to a job that they do not like, where they are not prospering, simply because they need the healthcare that that employer provides."
2019-07-31,Harris,"Itís time that we separate employers from the kind of healthcare people get, and under my plan, we do that. As it relates to the insurance and pharmaceutical companies-"
2019-07-31,Harris,Who will not be called in and who will not be taken to task by Senator Biden or Senator Bennetís plan-
2019-07-31,Harris,We will do that.
2019-07-31,Bennet,"Senator Harris is my friend as well, but I have to say, if we canít admit tonight whatís in the plan which is banning employer-based insurance, weíre not going to be able to admit that when Donald Trump is accusing Democrats of doing that as well. We need to be honest about whatís in this plan. It bans employer-based insurance and taxes the middle class to the tune of $30 trillion dollars. Do you know how much that is? That is 70% of what the government will collect in taxes over the next 10 years. We donít need to do that."
2019-07-31,Bennet,[crosstalk 00:30:23] We can have a public option and have-
2019-07-31,Bennet,[crosstalk 00:30:23] Universal healthcare in this country.
2019-07-31,Harris,"We cannot keep with the Republican talking points on this. You got to stop. The reality is that under my Medicare for All plan, yes. Employers are not going to be able to dictate the kind of healthcare that their employees get. They will be able to make that decision. Private insurance companies and private carriers, if they comply by our rules and play by our rules, weíll be able to offer those employees healthcare coverage under a private Medicare plan, or they can have the option of a public Medicare plan. But it is misleading to suggest that employees want what their employer is offering only, they want choice and my plan gives that to them."
2019-07-31,Inslee,"No, we need universal coverage and Iím proud of our state that has done less squabbling and actually getting things done. And I am proud that we are the first state to offer a publicly sanctioned offer of healthcare to our citizens. Iím also proud that we didnít stop there. Weíre also the first state that has taken care of our elders, our seniors. We have a looming retirement wave coming up, Iím proud that our state has made them eligible to retire in dignity."
2019-07-31,Inslee,"Iím also proud of this, and I think we need to talk more about this as Democrats. It is time to give people adequate mental healthcare in this country. And we are having, we are having some success in integrating mental health with physical health. Thereís no reason we should distinguish between your physiological and your mental health. And the last thing weíre doing, I think itís very instructive for the nation, we know weíre being eaten alive by pharmaceutical costs. Weíve had one of, if not the most innovate way to drive down pharmaceuticals for life-saving medications in the United States. Thatís a record of Washington state Iíd like to take to Washington DC."
2019-07-31,Yang,"I just want to share a story. When I told my wife I was running for president, you know the first question she asked me? What are we going to do about our healthcare? Thatís a true story and itís not just us, Democrats are talking about healthcare in the wrong way. As someone whoís run a business, I can tell you flat out our current healthcare system makes it harder to hire. It makes it harder to treat people well and give them benefits and treat them as full-time employees. It makes it harder to switch jobs, as Senator Harris just said, and itís certainly a lot harder to start a business. If we say, ìLook, weíre going to get healthcare off the backs of businesses and families, then watch American entrepreneurship recover and bloom.î Thatís the argument we should be making to the American people."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"Yeah. I donít understand why Democrats on this stage are fear-mongering about universal healthcare. It makes no sense. Ask the American people, they are sick of what the pharmaceutical companies are doing to them. Ask them what they feel about the health insurance companies, they feel itís holding back their families because they canít get the coverage they need. They get a lot of nos, they donít get a lot of help from health insurance companies. Why are we not going to be the party that does something bold? That says, ìWe donít need to be dependent on private insurance.î We could have a system that actually covers everyone."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,You know what? Donald Trump won this state of Michigan by saying he was going to disrupt the status quo. How about we be the party thatís going to disrupt the status quo-
2019-07-31,de Blasio,For working people.
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"Certainly, with all due respect to Senator Bennet, what heís saying is absolutely inaccurate about taxes. Americans right now are paying so much money for their healthcare, ask people about the reality of premiums, deductibles, copays, out-of-pocket expenses."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,Thatís worse than any tax.
2019-07-31,de Blasio,And people are paying that right now.
2019-07-31,Bennet,"This has nothing to do with Republican talking points or the pharmaceutical industry. This has to do with having faith in the American people that they can make the right decisions for their families, and they can choose a public option. Bernie Sanders who said last night he wrote the damn bill, and he did just like I wrote the damn public option bill, is the guy who says itíll cost $32 trillion dollars, and then weíre going to have to raise those taxes to pay for it. He says that. Republicans donít say it. Donít try to distract from the truth."
2019-07-31,Bennet,You canít hide from the truth here-
2019-07-31,Bennet,[crosstalk 00:35:05] We need to be for universal healthcare.
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"Senator, if we as Democrats say, ìWeíre done with private insurance. It has only hurt the American people in so many ways. Weíre going to give them something that works for their families, full coverage that they can depend on.î If we say that, then thereís an election, the American people get to decide. The ultimate choice, Senator, is an election. And this should be the party that stands for universal healthcare and says, ìWeíre not going to accept anything less. Right now in America, so many people donít have the healthcare they need. That is a fact. Tens of millions of people, including-"
2019-07-31,de Blasio,Middle class people.
2019-07-31,de Blasio,Give them a chance to make that decision-
2019-07-31,de Blasio,Through an election.
2019-07-31,Biden,"This is not a Republican talking point. The Republicans are trying to kill Obamacare. Obamacare took care of 20 million people right off the bat. A hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. And in fact what we got is a public option, that in fact would allow anybody to buy in. No one has to keep their private insurance, they can buy into this plan, and they can buy into it with a $1,000 deductible, and never have to pay more than 8.5% of their income when they do it. And if they donít have any money, theyíll get in free. So this idea is a bunch of malarkey, what weíre talking about here."
2019-07-31,Biden,"The fact of the matter is, the fact of the matter is that there will be a deductible, itíll be a deductible in their paycheck. Bernie acknowledges it. Bernie acknowledges $30 trillion dollars has to all be paid, and I donít know what math you do in New York, I donít know what math you do in California, but I tell you, thatís a lot of money. And there will be a deductible. The deductible will be out of your paycheck, because thatís what would be required."
2019-07-31,Harris,"Yeah, letís talk about math. Letís talk about math. Letís talk about the fact that the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies last year along profited $72 billion dollars, and that is on the backs of American families. And under your plan, status quo, you do nothing to hold the insurance companies to task for what they have been doing to American families. In America today, a diabetes patient, one in four cannot afford their insulin. In America today-"
2019-07-31,Harris,"For those people who have overdosed from an opioid, there is a syringe that costs $4,000-"
2019-07-31,Harris,"That will save their life. It is immoral, it is untenable-"
2019-07-31,Harris,And it must change with Medicare for All.
2019-07-31,Harris,"Vice President Biden, your response?"
2019-07-31,Biden,"Real quick. I have the only plan that limits the ability of insurance companies to charge unreasonable prices. Flat out, number one. Number two, we should put some of these insurance executives who totally oppose my plan in jail for the nine billion opioids they sell out there. They are misrepresenting the American people, what need to be done. And lastly, hereís the deal: The deal is, letís figure out how this works. We immediately are able to cover everybody who wants to get off of their insurance plan they donít like, no matter what one it is, and-"
2019-07-31,Biden,"Off of their insurance plan they donít like, no matter what one it is and buy into a Medicare option. And they can buy the Gold Plan and theyíre not going to have to pay. Anyway."
2019-07-31,Castro,"Thank you for that question. You know, if you elect me president, youíre not electing me to follow, youíre electing me to lead. Open borders is a right wing talking point, and frankly Iím disappointed that some folks, including some folks on this stage have taken the bait. The only way that weíre going to guarantee that we donít have family separations in this country again is to repeal section 1325 of the Immigration Nationality Act. That is the law that this President, this administration is using to incarcerate migrant parents and then physically separate them from their children."
2019-07-31,Castro,"My immigration plan would also make sure that we put undocumented immigrants who havenít committed a serious crime on a pathway to citizenship. That we do a 21st century Marshall Plan with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala so that we can get to the root of this challenge, so people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of having to come the United States. Thatís how we can be smarter, more effective, and more humane when it comes to immigration policy."
2019-07-31,Bennet,"I disagree that we should decriminalize our border. This is personal for me, my momís an immigrant and she was separated from her parents during the Holocaust in Poland. For those reasons, I was part of the Gang of Eight that wrote, I wrote the immigration bill in 2013 with John McCain that passed the senate with 68 votes. That gave a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented people that are here, that would pass the most aggressive dream act that ha ever been conceived much less passed on the floor of the senate, and had 46 billion dollars of border security."
2019-07-31,Bennet,Every single Democrat voted for that bill.
2019-07-31,Bennet,And a lot of Republicans. That should be our position.
2019-07-31,Bennet,That is our position.
2019-07-31,Harris,"Well, again, with all due respect, after the last debate for example, I went to a place in Florida called Homestead. There is a private detention facility being paid for by your tax payer dollars, a private detention facility that currently houses 2700 children. By the way, there were members of usÖ Julian was there, members of Congress. They would not let us enter the place, members of the United States Congress. So I walked down the road, I climbed a ladder and I looked over the fence and Iím going to tell you what I saw."
2019-07-31,Harris,"I saw children lined up single file based on gender, being walked into barracks. The policies of this administration have been facilitated by laws on the book that allow them to be incarcerated as though theyíve committed crimes."
2019-07-31,Harris,These children have not committed crimes and should be not treated like criminals.
2019-07-31,Bennet,I think this is one in the end that we agree with. Thereís not a single person on this stage who if we were president would ever separate a child from their parents at the border.
2019-07-31,Bennet,"That is what this administration has done in the American peopleís name. They have turned our border into a symbol of nativist hostility. The symbol of this country before Donald Trump was president was the Statue of Liberty. That should be the symbol of the United States of America, not Donald Trumpís terrible [crosstalk 00:42:12]."
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"So, I think when you talk about whether this should be a crime, you have to remember who weíre talking about. When I was at the Texas border, I visited with women who had fled violence. A woman from El Salvador, owned a small business, gangs came to her and said, ìIf you donít give us all your money, weíre going to kill your family.î Thatís why she fled."
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"Another woman was raped, thatís why she fled. So this is who weíre talking about, and theyíre not criminals. So I believe that we should have a civil violation. No president before President Trump enforced the law in the way he has enforced it, because heís using it as the crutch to lock up women and children, to separate mothers and babies, to put them behind bars. So I donít think we should have a law on the books that could be so misused. It should be a civil violation, and we should make sure that we treat people humanely."
2019-07-31,Biden,"Absolutely not, number one. Number two, everything landed on the Presidentís desk but locusts. I found that Julian, excuse me, the secretary, we sat together in many meetings. I never heard him talk about any of this when he was the secretary."
2019-07-31,Biden,"The fact isÖ I donít know if you can hear, I can hear, but I donít know."
2019-07-31,Biden,"The fact is, what the senator from New York talked about is seeking asylum. The women she spoke to are entitled to asylum. That is not crossing the border illegally. What we should do is flood the zone to make sure we have people to make those decisions quickly."
2019-07-31,Biden,"With regard to the Secretaryís point. I already proposed and passed 750 million dollars for Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to be able to change the circumstance, why people fled in the first place. In addition to that, weíre in a circumstance where if in fact you say you can just cross the border, what do you say to all those people around the world who in fact want the same thing, to come to the United States and make their case? And if they donít, that they have to wait in line."
2019-07-31,Biden,"The fact of the matter is, you should be able to, if you cross the border illegally you should be able to be sent back, itís a crime. Itís a crime, and itís not one that in fact-"
2019-07-31,Castro,"Yeah, uh, first of all Mr. Vice President, it looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past and one of us hasnít. Let me begin by telling you-"
2019-07-31,Castro,"Let me just start out by answering that question. My immigration plan would also fix the broken legal immigration system, because we do have a problem with that. Secondly, the only way that weíre going to guarantee that these kinds of family separations donít happen in the future is that we need to repeal this law. Thereís still going to be consequences if somebody crosses the border. Itís a civil action."
2019-07-31,Castro,"Also, we have 654 miles of fencing. We have thousands of personnel at the border. We have planes, we have boats."
2019-07-31,Castro,"We have helicopters, we have security cameras."
2019-07-31,Castro,What we need are politicians-
2019-07-31,Castro,Ö that actually have some guts. on this issue.
2019-07-31,Biden,"I have guts enough to say his plan doesnít make sense. Hereís the deal. The fact of the matter is that in fact when people cross the border illegally, it is illegal to do it unless theyíre seeking asylum. People should have to get in line, thatís the problem. And the only reason this particular part of the law is being abused is because of Donald Trump. We should defeat Donald Trump and end this practice."
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"Our hearts break when we see those children at these detention facilities whoíve been separated from their parents. When we see human beings crowded into cages in abhorrent, inhumane conditions."
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"This is about leadership, and understanding that we can and should have both secure borders as well as humane immigration policies. We will have to stop separating children from their parents. Make it so itís easier for people to seek asylum in this country, make sure that we are securing our borders and making it so that people are able to use our legal immigration system by reforming those laws."
2019-07-31,Yang,Iím the son of immigrants myself. My father immigrated here as a graduate student and generated over 65 US patents for GE and IBM. I think thatís a pretty good deal for the United States. Thatís the immigration story we need to be telling. We canít always be focusing on some of the distress stories.
2019-07-31,Yang,"And if you go to a factory here in Michigan, you will not find wall to wall immigrants. You will find wall to wall robots and machines. Immigrants are being scapegoated for issues they have nothing to do with in our economy."
2019-07-31,Booker,"Well first of all, I just want to say again tonight we are playing into Republican hands, who have a very different view and theyíre trying to divide us against each other. Iím listening to the language of my colleagues. No, Mr. Vice President, we are not going to just let people cross the border."
2019-07-31,Booker,"And unlawful crossing is an unlawful crossing if you do it in the civil courts, or if you do it through the criminal courts. But the criminal courts is what is giving Donald Trump the ability to truly violate the human rights of people coming to our country, who no one surrenders their human rights."
2019-07-31,Booker,"And so doing it through the civil courts means that you wonít need these awful detention facilities, that Iíve been to, seeing children sleeping on pavement, people being put in cages, nursing mothers, small children. This is not necessary. We have seen, using the civil system, piloted programs that have 100% compliance with the civil courts, where people are evaluated. If they have no justifiable reason to be here, they are returned."
2019-07-31,Booker,"If they are, like the people I met in Juarez who were survivors of sexual assault, who we wouldnít even let come and present for asylum. We are butchering our values, and making ourselves less safe."
2019-07-31,Biden,"I agree with the Senator. The asylum process is a real process and this president is ruining it, it has nothing to do with that section of the law. Thatís what heís doing, number one."
2019-07-31,Biden,"Number two, we should in fact, and we have proposed and we tried to get past our administration, proposed significantly increasing the number of legal immigrants who are able to come. This country can tolerate a heck of a lot more people, and the reason weíre the country we are is weíve been able to cherry pick from the best of every culture. Immigrants built this country, thatís why weíre so special. It took courage, it took resilience, it took absolute confidence for them to come. And we should be encouraging people."
2019-07-31,Biden,"By the way, anybody who crosses the stage with a PhD, you should get a green card for seven years. We should keep them here."
2019-07-31,Inslee,"I think weíre missing two central statements we need to make. Number one, we can no longer allow a white nationalist to be in the White House, number one."
2019-07-31,Inslee,"Number twoÖ Number two, we have to make America what itís always been, a place of refuge. Weíve got to boos the number of people we except. Iím proud of being the first governor saying, ìSend us your Syrian refugees.î Iím proud to have been the first governor to stand up against Donald Trumpís Muslim ban. Iím proud to have sued him 21 times and beat him 21 times in a row, Iím ready for November 2020."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"Two points. One, itís all kind of a charade because thereís 11 million people here, and everyone in theory has broken the law, but theyíre part of our communities now, theyíre part of our economy, theyíre our neighbors. Why are we even discussing on one level whether itís a civil penalty or a criminal penalty, when itís an American reality and what we need is comprehensive immigration reform once and for all to fix it."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"Second, Vice President Biden, I didnít hear your response when the issues came up of all those deportations. You were Vice President of the United States, I didnít hear whether you tried to stop them or not using your power, your influence in the White House. Did you think it was a good idea, or did you think it was something that needed to be stopped?"
2019-07-31,Biden,"The President came along, and heís the guy that came up with the idea, first time ever, of dealing with the Dreamers. He put that in the law. He talked about a comprehensive plan which he lay before the congress saying that we should find a pathway to citizenship for people. He said we should up the number of people that weíre able to bring into this country."
2019-07-31,Biden,"Lastly, he also pointed out that we should go to the source of the problem and fix it, where people were leaving in the first place. To compare him to Donald Trump I think is absolutely bizarre."
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"I donít. I think itís important for us to fix our legal immigration system and look at the millions of undocumented immigrants in this country who have been suffering as theyíve been living in the shadows, and instead of putting a bandaid on this problem, fix our legal immigration system to provide them with that pathway to legal residency or citizenship so that they are no longer treated as second class citizens in this country."
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"Weíve got to look at the challenge that people all across this country are facing under crushing student debt. This is something that is impacting my generation in a huge way, and I believe that it is our generation that has the bold, creative solutions to be able to solve it. This is about promise for our future and weíve got to make those kinds of investments."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"Yeah, I agree with the Congress member, but I donít hear an answer from the Vice President, Iím confused. I asked the Vice President point blank, did he use his power to stop those deportations? He went right around the question. Mr. Vice President, you want to be President of the United States, you need to be able to answer the tough questions. I guarantee you if youíre debating Donald Trump, heís not going to let you off the hook."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"So did you say those deportations were a good idea? Or did you go to the President and say, ìThis is a mistake, we shouldnít do it.î Which one?"
2019-07-31,Biden,"I was Vice President, I am not the President. I keep my recommendations to him in private. Unlike you, I expect you would go ahead and say whatever was said privately with him. Thatís not what I do."
2019-07-31,Biden,"What I do say to you is, he moved to fundamentally change the system. Thatís what he did. Thatís what he did, but much more has to be done. Much more has to be done."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,I still donít hear an answer.
2019-07-31,Booker,"Well, a couple things. First of all, Mr. Vice President, you canít have it both ways. You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You canít do it when itís convenient and then dodge it when itís not."
2019-07-31,Booker,"And the second thing, and this really irks me, because I heard the Vice President say that if youíve got a PhD, you can come right into this country. Well thatís playing into what the Republicans want, to pit some immigrants against other immigrants. Some are from shit hole countries, and some are from worthy countries."
2019-07-31,Booker,"We need to reform this whole immigration system and begin to be the country that says everyone has worth and dignity, and this should be a country that honors for everyone. Donít let the Republicans divide this party against itself."
2019-07-31,Biden,"The fact is thatís what I said about this country. We are a country of immigrants, all of us. All of us. Some here came against their will, others came because they in fact thought they could fundamentally change their lives. And they did. The [inaudible 00:54:33] thatís what weíre talking about. Thatís what made us great. And the fact of the matter is, I think the President of the United States, Barack Obama went out of his way to try to change the system and he got pushed back significantly."
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"Again, President Trump, under his administration, seven children died in his custody. Under his administration families have been torn apart. This party is talking about real ideas for the future. Weíre talking about what we will do to change America. But we must not forget about our values."
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"We used to believe in this country you should treat others the way you want to be treated. We used to believe in this country we should care about the least among us. Letís remind the American people who we are, why we are Democrats and why weíre running for president .."
2019-07-31,Biden,"Well, I donít Ö I think he is wrong. I think we should work together. He has a similar plan. I think that we should change the way we look at prisons. Right now, weíre in a situation where when someone is convicted of a drug crime, they end up going to jail and to prison. They should be going to rehabilitation. They shouldnít be going to prison."
2019-07-31,Biden,"When in prison, they should be learning to read and write and not just sit in there and learn how to be better criminals. And when they get out of prison, they should be in a situation where they have access to everything they wouldíve had before, including Pell grants for education, including making sure that theyíre able to have housing, public housing, including they have all the opportunities that were available them because we want them to become better citizens. Thatís the essence of what my plan in detail lays out."
2019-07-31,Biden,"Iím happy to discuss it more in detail if the senator want to, and so I looked at it Ö Anyway. Thatís what I think my plan Ö I know what my plan does, and I think itís not dissimilar to what the senator said we should be working together on getting things done. Itís a-"
2019-07-31,Booker,"Well, my response is that this is a crisis in our country because we have treated issues of race and poverty, mental health and addiction, with locking people up and not lifting them up. And Mr. Vice President has said that since the 1970s, every major crime bill, every crime bill, major and minor, has had his name on it. And so those are your words, not mine. And this is one of those instances where the house was set on fire, and you claimed responsibility for those laws. And you canít just now come out with a plan to put out that fire."
2019-07-31,Booker,"We have got to have far more bold action on criminal justice reform, like having-"
2019-07-31,Booker,"Ö true marijuana justice, which means that-"
2019-07-31,Booker,Ö we legalize it on a federal level-
2019-07-31,Booker,Ö and reinvest the profits in communities-
2019-07-31,Booker,Ö that have been disproportionately targeted by marijuana enforcement.
2019-07-31,Biden,"The fact is that the bills that the President, that Ö Excuse me. The future President here. That the senator is talking about are bills that were passed years ago, and they were passed overwhelmingly."
2019-07-31,Biden,"Since 2007, I, for example, tried to get the crack powder cocaine totally Ö disparity, totally eliminated. In 2007, you became mayor, and you had a police department that was Ö You went out, and you hired Rudy Giulianiís guy. You engaged in stop and frisk. You had 75% of those stops reviewed as illegal. You found yourself in this situation with three times as many African-American kids were caught in that chain and caught up. The Justice Department came after you for saying you were engaging in behavior that was inappropriate, and then in fact, and nothing happened, the entire time you were mayor."
2019-07-31,Booker,"Well, first of all, Iím grateful that he endorsed my presidency already, but Iíll tell you this. Itís no secret that I inherited a criminal Ö a police department with massive problems and decades-long challenges. But the head of the ACLU has already said, the head of the New Jersey ACLU, that I put forth national standards setting accountability. Mr. Vice President-"
2019-07-31,Biden,At that point?
2019-07-31,Booker,"Mr. Vice President, I didnít interrupt you."
2019-07-31,Biden,[crosstalk 00:03: 30].
2019-07-31,Booker,"Please show me that respect, sir. We have a system right now thatís broken, and if you want to compare records, and frankly, Iím shocked that you do, I am happy to do that because all the problems that he is talking about that he created, I actually led the bill that got passed into law that reverses the damage that your bills that you are frankly to correct you, Mr. Vice President, you are bragging, calling it the Biden crime bill up until 2015."
2019-07-31,Biden,"Number one. The bill he talks about is a bill that, in my Ö our administration, we passed. We passed that bill that you added onto. Thatís the bill, in fact, you passed. And the fact of the matter is secondly, there was nothing done for the entire eight years he was mayor. There was nothing done to deal with the police department that was trouble. Why did you announce in the first day a zero tolerance policy of stop and frisk and hire Rudy Giulianiís guy in 2007 when I was trying to get rid of the crack cocaine [crosstalk 00:04:30]?"
2019-07-31,Booker,"Mr. Vice President, thereís a saying in my community: youíre dipping into the Kool-Aid, and you donít even know the flavor."
2019-07-31,Booker,"You need to come to the city of Newark and see the reforms that we put in place. The New Jersey head of the ACLU has said that I embraced reforms, not just in action, but in deed. Sir, you are trying to shift the view from what you created."
2019-07-31,Booker,"There are people right now in prison for life, for drug offenses because you stood up and used that tough on crime, phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroy communities like mine. This isnít about the past, sir. This is about the present right now."
2019-07-31,Booker,I believe in redemption.
2019-07-31,Booker,Iím happy you evolved-
2019-07-31,Booker,Ö but you offered no redemption to the people in prison right now for life.
2019-07-31,Castro,"I agree with Senator Booker that a lot of what Vice President helped author in í94 was a mistake, and he has flip flopped on these things, and thatís clear. But let me say, when we talk about criminal justice reform, there are a lot of things that we can talk about: sentencing reform, cash bail reform, investing in public defenders, diversion programs. Iím proud that Iím the only candidate that has put forward a police reform plan because we have a police system that is broken and we need to fix it and whether itís the case of someone like Tamir Rice or Michael Brown or Eric Garner, where the Trump Justice Department just decided not to pursue charges. We do ensure we have a national use of force standard and that we end qualified immunity for police officers so that we can hold them accountable for using excessive force."
2019-07-31,Inslee,[crosstalk 00:06:09] I need to [crosstalk 00:06:12]-
2019-07-31,Inslee,"Let me suggest that people come out to the state of Washington and see what criminal justice reform looks like, our effort to reduce racial disparity. Iím proud that I was the first governor to offer pardons to thousands of people with drug crimes. Now weíre vacating more tens of thousands. Weíve eliminated the death penalty. And importantly, weíve done this. When people come out of the legal system and theyíve done their responsibility to the citizens, we need to make sure they can get a job. We have ban the box so that people can actually get a job when they come out."
2019-07-31,Inslee,"And Iíve got to argue with my friend, Secretary Castro. We havenít just put forward a plan. We have adopted probably one of the best police accountability measures and train our police officers in deescalation techniques so we have less violence [crosstalk 00:00:07:02]."
2019-07-31,Castro,"Well that itís much more than that because what we see, and this was a good example, the other day of the Department of Justice not going after Officer Pantaleo that Ö Officer Pantaleo used a chokehold that was prohibited by NYPD. He did that for seven seconds. 11 different times, Eric Garner said that he couldnít breathe. He knew what he was doing, that he was killing Eric Garner, and yet he has not been brought to justice. That police officer should be off the street."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"Let me tell you. I know the Garner family. Theyíve gone through extraordinary pain. They are waiting for justice, and theyíre going to get justice. Thereís finally going to be justice. I have confidence in that, in the next 30 days in New York. You know why? Because for the first time, we are not waiting on the federal justice department, which told the city of New York that we could not proceed because the justice department was pursuing their prosecution. And years went by, and a lot of pain accrued."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"And in the meantime, what Iím working on is making sure, and I have for five years, there will never be another tragedy, theyíll never be another Eric Garner because weíre changing fundamentally how we police."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"But thereís one last point I have to say about the Justice Department. The Vice President, for two and a half of those years, Mr, Vice President, tell us what did you do to try and spur on the Justice Department-"
2019-07-31,de Blasio,Ö to act in the Garner case?
2019-07-31,Biden,"We did a lot. Number one, we made sure we reduced the federal prison population by 38,000 people. Number one. Number two, we in fact insisted that we change the rules of police engaging. They had to have Ö We provided for body cameras. We made sure that there were a lot of things that were changed in the process. But 38,000 people in the federal system were released under the system."
2019-07-31,Biden,"And so the fact is that thereís a lot weíve done. But hereís the deal. The fact is that weíre talking about things that occurred a long, long time ago, and now all of a sudden, I find it fascinating. Everybodyís talking about how terrible I am on these issues. Barack Obama knew exactly who I was. He had 10 lawyers do a background check on everything about me on civil rights and civil liberties, and he chose me, and he said it was the best decision he made."
2019-07-31,Biden,[crosstalk 00:09:30].
2019-07-31,Yang,I speak for just about everyone watching when I say I would trust anyone on this stage much more than I would trust our current president on matters of criminal justice. We cannot tear each other down. We have to focus on beating Donald Trump in 2020.
2019-07-31,Yang,"I want to share a story that a prison guard, a corrections officer in New Hampshire said to me. He said we should pay people to stay out of jail because we spend so much when theyíre behind bars. Right now, we think weíre saving money. We just end up spending the money in much more dark and punitive ways. We should put money directly into peopleís hands, certainly, when they come out of prison, but before they go into prison."
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"No. He should be fired. He should be fired now. I sat down with Eric Garnerís mother, and I can tell you when youíve lost your son, when he begged for breath, when you know because you have a video, when you know he said, ìI canít breathe,î so many times, over and over again, when you know he used an illegal chokehold, that person should be fired. If I was the mayor, Iíd fire him, but as President, I would make sure that we had a full investigation, that the report would be made public, and if I wasnít satisfied, we would have a consent decree."
2019-07-31,Harris,"That is simply false and letís be very clear about this. When Vice President Biden was in the United States Senate working with segregationist to oppose busing, which was the vehicle by which we would integrate Americaís public schools, had I been in the United States Senate at that time, I would have been completely on the other side of the aisle. And letís be clear about this, had those segregationists their way, I would not be a member of the United States Senate. Cory Booker would not be a member of the United States Senate and Barack Obama would not have been in a position to nominate him for the title he now holds."
2019-07-31,Harris,"And so, on that issue, we could not be more apart, which is that the vice president has still failed to acknowledge that it was wrong to take the position that he took at that time. Now I would like to also talk about this conversation about Eric Garner because I too met with his mother, and one of the things that weíve got to be clear about is that this President of the United States, Donald Trump, while he has been in office, has quietly been allowing the United States Department of Justice to shut down consent decrees, to stop pattern and practice investigations on that case."
2019-07-31,Harris,"We also know that the [crosstalk 00:12:40] civil rights division, this is important, the civil rights division of the United States Department of Justice said charges should have been filed, but this United States Department of Justice usurped, and I believe it is because that president did not want those charges to go forward and they overrode a decision by the civil rights division of the United States [crosstalk 00:12:58] Department of Justice. Under my administration the civil rights [crosstalk 00:13:01] will reign and there will be independent investigations."
2019-07-31,Biden,"When Senator Harris was the Attorney General for eight years in the state of California, there were two of the most segregated school districts in the country. In Los Angeles and in San Francisco. And she did not, I didnít see a single solitary time she brought a case against them to desegregate them."
2019-07-31,Biden,"Secondly, she also was in a situation where she had a police department when she was there, that in fact was abusing peopleís rights. And the fact was that she in fact was told by her own people that her own staff that she should do something about and disclose to defense attorneys like me, that you in fact have been, the police officer did something that did not give you information that would explicate your client. She didnít do that. She never did it. And so what happened? Along came a federal judge and said, ìEnough, enough,î and he freed [crosstalk 00:13:59] a thousand of these people. If you doubt me, Google a thousand prisoners freed, Kamala Harris."
2019-07-31,Harris,"That is simply not true and as Attorney General of California where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice, I am proud of the work we did. Work that has received national recognition for what has been the important work of reforming a criminal justice system and cleaning up the consequences of the bills that you passed when you were in the United States Senate for decades."
2019-07-31,Harris,It was the work of creating one of the first in the nation initiatives around reentering former offenders and getting them jobs and counseling.
2019-07-31,Harris,I did the work as Attorney General of putting body cameras-
2019-07-31,Harris,On special agents [crosstalk 00:14:46] in the state of California and Iím proud of that work.
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"I want to bring the conversation back to the broken criminal justice system, that is disproportionately negatively impacting black and brown people all across this country today."
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"Oh, Senator Harris says sheís proud of her record as a prosecutor and that sheíll be a prosecutor president. But Iím deeply concerned about this record. There are too many examples to cite, but she put over 1500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana."
2019-07-31,Gabbard,She blocked evidence that would have freed an innocent man from death row until the courts forced her to do so. She kept people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California and she fought to keep [crosstalk 00:15:44] cash bail system in place that impacts poor people in the worst kind of way.
2019-07-31,Harris,"As the elected Attorney General of California, I did the work of significantly reforming the criminal justice system of a state of 40 million people, which became a national model for the work that needs to be done. And I am proud of that work and I am proud of making a decision to not just give fancy speeches or be in a legislative body and give speeches on the floor, but actually doing the work of being in the position to use the power that I had to reform a system that is badly in need of reform."
2019-07-31,Harris,That is why we created initiatives that were about reentering former offenders and getting them counseling.
2019-07-31,Harris,It is why and because I know that criminal justice system is so broken-
2019-07-31,Harris,That I am an advocate for what [crosstalk 00:16:35] we need to do to not only [crosstalk 00:16:36] but legalize marijuana in the United States.
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"The bottom line is, Senator Harris, when you were in a position to make a difference and an impact in these peopleís lives, you did not. And worse yet in the case of those who were on death row, innocent people, you actually blocked evidence from being revealed that would have freed them until you were forced to do so. There is no excuse for that. And the people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor, you owe them an apology."
2019-07-31,Harris,My entire career I have been-
2019-07-31,Harris,Adopt a green new deal on day one as president.
2019-07-31,Harris,I would reenter us in the Paris Agreement.
2019-07-31,Harris,And put in place so we would be carbon neutral by 2030.
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"So the first thing that Iím going to do when Iím president is Iím going to Clorox the Oval Office. The second thing Iím going to do, is I will reengage on global climate change, and I will not only sign the Paris global climate accords, but I will lead a worldwide conversation about the urgency of this crisis."
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"The greatest threat to humanity is global climate change. I visited a family in Iowa who water spewed into her home, Fran Par, it tossed her refrigerator upend, all the furniture was broken, all the dishes were broken and mud was everywhere. That is the impact of severe weather right now on families lives."
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"And so the truth is we need a robust solution. When John F. Kennedy said, ìI want to put a man on the moon in the next 10 years, not because itís easy, but because itís hard.î He knew it was going to be a measure of our innovation, our success, our ability to galvanize worldwide competition. He wanted to have a space race with Russia. Why not have a green energy race with China? Why not have clean air and clean water for all Americans? Why not rebuild our infrastructure? Why not actually invest in the green jobs? Thatís what the Green New Deal is about."
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"Not only will I pass it, but I will put a price on carbon to make market forces help us."
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"Oh, first of all, this is personal. You can imagine, I grew up in Hawaii, which is the most remote island chain in the world. So for us growing up there, protecting our environment was not a political issue., itís a way of life. Itís part of our culture. Itís part of who we are. This is why as a member of congress long before there was ever a Green New Deal, I introduced the most ambitious climate change legislation ever in Congress called the Off Fossil Fuels Act. That actually laid out an actionable plan to take us from where we are today, to transition off of fossil fuels and invest in green renewable energy. Invest in workforce training, invest in the kinds of infrastructure that we need to deal with the problems and the challenges that climate is posing to us today."
2019-07-31,Booker,"I just want to take, first of all, a step back and say that I agree wholeheartedly with Governor Inslee, and itís one of the reasons why Greenpeace ranks me and him at the top of this entire field [crosstalk 00:19:58] I want to say very clearly, thank you man, thank you. Iíll try harder. Look, the reason why is because first of all, this problem didnít start yesterday. Science didnít become a reality yesterday. This has been going on for years. There was another president that would not join an international accord. Then it was the Kyoto accord. I was mayor then and I stood up in national leadership, joining with other mayors to say climate change is not a separate issue."
2019-07-31,Booker,"It must be the issue and the lens with which you view every issue. Nobody should get applause for rejoining the Paris climate accords, that is kindergarten. We have to go to far advance and makes sure that everything from our trade deals, everything from the billions of dollars we spend to foreign aid, everything must be sublimated to the challenge and the crisis that is existential, which is dealing with the climate threat. And yes, the majority of this problem is outside the United States, but the only way weíre going to deal with this-"
2019-07-31,Booker,Is that the United States leads.
2019-07-31,Harris,"Thank you senator, Mayor de Blasio, your administration has come under fire after hundreds of children living in New York City public housing tested positive for elevated levels of lead. As you know, weíre not far from Flint, Michigan, where residents are still dealing with the consequences of having lead in their drinking water. How can you assure the people of Flint and across the nation that you are the right person to handle such a problem?"
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"We have a huge problem and itís decades old in New York, but hereís what weíve done about it. Weíve declared the eradication of all lead, literally ending the notion of lead poisoning once and for all as the goal of our administration, and weíre doing something about it. Lead poisoning has gone down 90% since 2005 and weíre going to literally bring it down to zero, because weíre going to go into every place, buildings, schools, public housing, and take out that lead, remediate that lead once and for all, and that needs to be done all over this country. Now, the federal government used to not take any responsibility for-"
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"Ö country. Now, the federal government used to not take any responsibility for our public housing. For decades theyíve been disinvesting in the public housing that was supposed to be a federal responsibility. Thatís part of why we have this lead crisis to begin with. But Iíll tell you what you do when youíre actually in charge of something. Iím in charge of the largest city in this nation. You do not accept the status quo, you fix it. And so we are going into every one of those apartments to make sure those children and those families are safe, and then we are going to eradicate that lead once and for all. And there should be a federal mandate to do the same for Flint, for Detroit, for every place in this country. It can be done."
2019-07-31,Castro,"Well, because people donít have to wonder what I would do. Iíve actually done it. I was Secretary of Housing and Urban Development when Flint had its water crisis. I went to Flint. We did what we could to help folks get water filters. And then we didnít stop there. We improved the standard of how we deal with elevated blood lead levels in children. A lot of Americans donít know that this is still a major problem out there. I was back in Flint about six weeks ago, and I released a plan to invest $50 billion so that we remove lead as a major public health threat. We need to do it, we can do it, and I will do it."
2019-07-31,Biden,"Because we did it. I was asked to manage an $87 billion plan, to be spent in a total of 18 months, that revived this state and many others, and it kept us out of a depression, with two-tenths of 1% of waste or fraud. Secondly, I was part of the organization within our administration that pushed bailing General Motors out, saving tens of thousands of jobs here in this state. Number three. Number three, I also was asked, as the Mayor of Detroit can tell you, by the president of the United States to help Detroit get out of bankruptcy and get back on its feet. I spent better part of two years out here working to make sure that it did exactly that. We invested significantly in this city, in transportation. Anyway, the point is, weíve made significant investments in this state. I expect in this city, I expect thatís why the mayor endorsed me."
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"To the people of Michigan, I know exactly how Iíd beat President Trump. Iíve already done it. I took a bus tour to talk about Trumpís broken promises here in Michigan. He promised no bad trade deals. Not only did he not have bad trade deals, he started a trade war with China, and he just signed onto another bad trade agreement with NAFTA 2.0, a giveaway to drug companies in Mexico. I took the bus to Michigan, to Ohio, and to Pennsylvania, telling people that he has broken his promises to them. I lifted up their voices, I listened to their concerns, and I offered real solutions. And Iíve done this before. My first House district I ran in was a two-to-one Republican district. I won it twice, and I havenít lost an election since. So I can bring people together in red, purple, and blue areas. But more than that, I can get things done."
2019-07-31,Yang,"Well, Iím building a coalition of disaffected Trump voters, independents, libertarians, and conservatives, as well as Democrats and progressives. I believe Iím the candidate best suited to beat Donald Trump. And as for how to win in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania, the problem is that so many people feel like the economy has left them behind. What we have to do is we have to say look, there is record high GDP and stock market prices. You know what else are at record highs? Suicides, drug overdoses, depression, anxiety. Itís gotten so bad that American life expectancy has declined for the last three years."
2019-07-31,Yang,"And I like to talk about my wife whoís at home with our two boys right now, one of whom is autistic. What does her work count at in todayís economy? Zero, and we know thatís the opposite of the truth. We know that her work is among the most challenging and vital. The way we win this election is we redefine economic progress to include all the things that matter to the people in Michigan and all of us, like our own health, our well-being, our mental health, our clean air and clean water, how our kids are doing. If we change the measurements for the 21st century economy to revolve around our own well-being, then we will win this election."
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"Donald Trump won this election because far too many people in this country felt like theyíve been left behind by both political parties, by self-serving politicians on both sides who are more interested in partisan politics than they are in actually fighting for the people. Iím speaking the truth to people all across this country about the fact that people in Flint, Michigan are still being left behind, still being poisoned by the water in their system. Because every single month we are spending $4 billion on a continuing war in Afghanistan, $4 billion every single month, rather than ending that war, bringing our troops home, and using those precious resources into serving the needs of the people here in this country, people and communities like Flint. Thatís the kind of leadership that Iíll bring."
2019-07-31,Booker,"Iím grateful. Iím grateful. Jake, look, this is one of those times where weíre not staring at the truth and calling it out, and this is a case for the Democratic Party, the truth will set us free. We lost the State of Michigan, because everybody from Republicans to Russians were targeting the suppression of African American voters. We need to say that. If the African American vote in this state had been like it was four years earlier, we would have won the State of Michigan. We need to have a campaign that is ready for whatís coming, an all-out assault, especially on the most valuable voter group in our, in fact, the highest-performing voter group in our coalition, which is black women. And so I will be a person that tries to fight against voter suppression, that can activate and engage the kind of voters and coalitions that are going to win states like Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin."
2019-07-31,Harris,"First of all, Donald Trump came in making a whole lot of promises to working people that he did not keep. He said he was going to help farmers. He said he was going to help auto workers. Farmers are now looking at bankruptcy, soybeans rotting in bales. Auto workers, we expect perhaps hundreds of thousands will be out of jobs by the end of the year. Jerome Powell just dropped the interest rates, and he admitted why, because of this so-called trade policy that this president has that has been nothing more than the Trump trade tax that has resulted in American families spending as much as $1.4 billion more a month on everything from shampoo to washing machines. He betrayed the American people, he betrayed American families, and he will lose this election, because folks are clear that he has done nothing except try to beat people down instead of lift people up. And thatís what we want in the next president of the United States."
2019-07-31,Castro,"Well, first of all, there are a lot of Americans right now that are hurting. Just go and ask the folks that just received notice that theyíre going to get been laid off by General Motors. Or ask the many folks who are sleeping on the streets in big cities and small towns across the United States. Or ask fast food workers that I joined a couple of weeks ago that are working for minimum wage and canít provide for their families or pay the rent. So the idea that America is doing just fine is wrong. Not only that, this president always likes to take credit like he did this. Weíve now had about 105 straight months of positive job growth, the longest streak in American history. Over 80 months of that was due to President Barack Obama. Thank you, Barack Obama. Thank you, Barack Obama. So I believe that we need to invest in what will ensure that Americans can prosper in the years to come. Making sure they have the knowledge and skills to compete in the 21st century economy. Ensuring that they can afford the rent where they live and that they have health care so that they donít have to worry about going homeless because they canít afford a medical procedure."
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"By pushing for fair trade. Not trade deals that give away the sovereignty of the American people and our country, that give away American jobs, and that threaten our environment. These were the three main issues with that massive trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I think the central one was the fact that it gave away our sovereignty to a panel of international corporations whose rulings would supersede any domestic law that we would pass, either a federal law or a state or a local law. This is extremely dangerous and goes against the very values that we have as a country. What to speak of the fact that it would have a negative impact on domestic jobs and that it lacked clear protections for our environment. These are the things that we have to keep at the forefront as we look to enact fair trade deals with other countries to make sure that we continue to be a thriving part of our global economy."
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"I would not, because the approach that President Trump has taken has been extremely volatile without any clear strategic plan and it has a ravaging and devastating effect on our domestic manufacturers, on our farmers, who are already struggling and now failing to see the light of day because of the plan that Trump has taken."
2019-07-31,Biden,"Iíd renegotiate it. We make up 25% of the worldís economy. In orderÖ Either Chinaís going to write the rules of the road for the 21st century on trade or we are. We have to join with the 40% of the world that we had with us, and this time makes sure that thereís no one sitting at that table doing the deal unless environmentalists are there and labor is there. And to make sure we equip our workers first to compete by investing in them now, in the things that make them more competitive. Thatís what we have to do. Otherwise they are going to write the rules of the road. We must have the rest of the world join us to keep them-"
2019-07-31,Biden,Ö In check from abusing it.
2019-07-31,Biden,I would not rejoin the TTP as it was initially put forward. I would insist that we renegotiate pieces of that with the Pacific nations that we had in South America and North America so that we could bring them together to hold China accountable for the rules of us setting the rules of the road as to how trade should be conducted. Otherwise theyíre going to do exactly what theyíre doing. Fill the vacuum and run the table.
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"Yeah. And I would just want to ask this question of all the candidates, but particularly of Vice President Biden. President Trump is trying to sell NAFTA 2.0. Heís got a new name for it. Itís just as dangerous as the old NAFTA. Itís going to take away American jobs like the old NAFTA, like it did to Michigan. And we cannot have Democrats be party to a new NAFTA. So Vice President, I believe youíre the only person on the stage who voted for the original NAFTA. Are you ready to say here and now that you will oppose a new NAFTA? And that what you will believe in, which a lot of us hope for, is trade treaties that empower organized labor across the boundaries of the world and give working people power again, not just multinational corporations."
2019-07-31,Biden,Yes.
2019-07-31,Biden,Yes.
2019-07-31,Biden,"No, he said would I insist that labor be engaged? The answer is yes."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,I consider that a victory.
2019-07-31,Biden,"Well, I love your affection for me. You spend a lot of time with me."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"You know what? We believe in redemption, Joe. We believe in redemption in this party."
2019-07-31,Biden,"Well, I tell you what. I hope youíre part of it."
2019-07-31,Bennet,"Dana this goes to the last question you asked as well, which is how are we going to remain competitive? Itís not just about trade, which we were talking about earlier. Itís about whether weíre going to invest in this country anymore. Since 2001 we have cut five trillion dollars worth of taxes. Almost all of that has gone to the wealthiest people in America. We have made the income inequality worse, not better, through the policies of the federal government. Weíve spent 5.6 trillion dollars in the Middle East. Thatís 12 or 13 trillion dollars that, from the point of view of driving the economy in Michigan or anywhere else in America, we might as well just have lit that money on fire. Weíve got to stop doing that. And we need to invest in America again. For the money that weíve spent, that I just described, we could have fixed every road and bridge in this country. We could have fixed every airport that needs to be fixed. We could have fixed, not just Flint, but every-"
2019-07-31,Bennet,Ö Water system in this country. We couldíve made social security solvent for my children.
2019-07-31,Bennet,But we did none of it because of self-serving politicians in Washington DC who voted for deals that were good for them.
2019-07-31,Bennet,But not for Michigan or the American people.
2019-07-31,Yang,"I have seen firsthand the inequities in the business world where women are concerned, particularly in startups and entrepreneurship. We have to do more at every step. And, if you are a woman entrepreneur, the obstacles start not just at home. But then when you seek a mentor or an investor often they donít look like you and they might not think your idea is the right one. In order to give women a leg up, what we have to do is we have to think about women in every situation, including the ones who are in exploitative and abusive jobs and relationships around the country. Iím talking about the waitress whoís getting harassed by her boss at the diner, who might have a business idea, but right now is stuck where she is. What we have to do is we have to give women the economic freedom to be able to improve their own situations and start businesses. And the best way to do this is by putting a dividend of $1,000 a month into their hands. It would be a game changer for women around the country because we know that women do more of the unrecognized and uncompensated work in our society. It will not change unless we change it. And I say thatís just what we do."
2019-07-31,Harris,"I think that supported my proposal, which is this, since 1963 when we passed the Equal Pay Act we have been talking about the fact women are not paid equally for equal work. Fast forward to the Year of our Lord 2019 and women are paid 80 cents on the dollar. Black women, 61 cents. Native American woman, 58 cents. Latinas, 53 cents. Iím done with the conversation. So, yes, I am proposing in order to deal with this, one, Iím going to require corporations to post on their website whether they are paying women equally for equal work. Two, they will be fined. For every 1% differential between what theyíre paying men and women they will be find 1% of their previous yearís profits. Thatíll get everybodyís attention."
2019-07-31,Harris,Time for action.
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"I think we have to have a broader conversation about whether we value women and whether we want to make sure women have every opportunity in the workplace. And I want to address Vice President Biden directly. When the Senate was debating middle-class affordability for childcare, he wrote an Op-ed. He voted against it, the only vote. But what he wrote an Op-ed was that he believed that women working outside the home would, ìCreate the deterioration of family.î He also said that women who were working outside the home were, ìAvoiding responsibility.î And I just need to understand, as a woman whoís worked my entire career as the primary-wage earner, as the primary caregiverÖ In fact, my second son Henry is here and I had him when I was a member of Congress. So, under Vice President Bidenís analysis, am I serving in Congress resulting in the deterioration of the family because I had access to quality, affordable daycare? I just want to know what he meant when he said that."
2019-07-31,Biden,"That was a long time ago and hereís what it was about. It would have given people making today $100,000 a year a tax break for childcare. I did not want that. I wanted the childcare to go to people making less than $100,000 and thatís what it was about. As a single father, who in fact raised three children for five years by myself, I have some idea what it costs. I support making sure that every single, solitary person needing child care get an $8,000 tax credit. Now, that would put 700,000 women back to work, increase the GDP by almost eight-tenths of 1%. Itís the right thing to do. If we can give tax breaks to corporations for these things, why canít we do it this way?"
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"But, Mr. Vice President, you didnít answer my question. What did you mean when you said when a woman works outside the home, itís resulting in, ìThe deterioration of family.î"
2019-07-31,Biden,No. What I-
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,And that we are avoidingÖ These are quotes. It was the title of the Op-ed.
2019-07-31,Biden,No.
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,And that just causes concern for me. Because we know Americaís women are working. Four out of 10 moms have to work. They are the primary or sole wage earners. They actually have to put food on the table. Eight out of 10 moms are working today. Most women have to work to provide for their kids. Many women want to be working to provide for their communities and to help people.
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,Either you donít believe it today or what did you mean when you said it then?
2019-07-31,Biden,"In the very beginning my deceased wife worked when we had children. My present wife has worked all the way through raising our children. The fact of the matter is the situation is one that I donít know whatís happened. I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. Lilly Ledbetter, I was deeply involved in making sure thereís the equal pay amendments. I was deeply involved in all these things. I came up with the Itís On Us proposal to see to it the women were treated more decently on college campuses. You came to Syracuse University with me and said it was wonderful. Iím passionate about the concern, making sure women are treated equally. I donít know whatís happened except that youíre now running for president."
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"So I understandÖ Mr. Vice President? Mr. Vice President, I respect you deeply. I respect you deeply. But those words are very specific. You said women working outside the home would lead to the deterioration of family. My grandmother worked outside the home."
2019-07-31,Biden,So did-
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,My mother worked outside the home.
2019-07-31,Biden,Thatís-
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,And for-
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,Well he hasnítÖ Either-
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"Either he no longer believes it. I mean, I just think he needs to-"
2019-07-31,Biden,I never believed it.
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,Okay.
2019-07-31,Harris,"Well, I justÖ Listen, I mean, talk about now running for president and you change your position. On the Hyde Amendment, Vice President, where you made a decision for years to withhold resources to poor women to have access to reproductive healthcare and including women who were the victims of rape and incest. Do you now say that you have evolved and you regret that? Because youíve only, since youíve been running for president this time, said that you in some way would take that back or you didnít agree with the decision that you made over many, many years."
2019-07-31,Biden,Iím getting to-
2019-07-31,Harris,"And this directly impacted so many women in our country. And I personally prosecuted rape cases and child molestation cases. And the experience that those women have, those children have, and that they would then be denied the resources-"
2019-07-31,Harris,I think is unacceptable.
2019-07-31,Biden,"The fact is that the Senator knows thatís not my position. Everybody on this stage whoís been in the Congress and the Senate or House has voted for the Hyde Amendment at some point. The Hyde Amendment, in the past, was available because there was other access for those kinds of services provided privately. But once I wrote the legislation making sure that every single woman would in fact have an opportunity to have health care paid for by the federal government, everyone, that that could no longer stand. I support a womanís right to choose. I support it. Itís a constitutional right. Iíve supported it and I will continue to support it. And I will, in fact, move as president to see to that the congress legislates that that is the law as well."
2019-07-31,Harris,"Well, why did it take you so long to change your position on the Hyde Amendment? Why did it take so long until you were running for president to change your position on the Hyde Amendment?"
2019-07-31,Biden,Because there was not full federal funding for all reproductive services prior to this point.
2019-07-31,Harris,Okay.
2019-07-31,Inslee,"I would suggest that we need to broaden our discussion. I would suggest we need to think about a bigger scandal in America, which is that in professions and careers where women have been more than the majority, they have been almost always underpaid. And that is why this year Iím proud to be the governor who won the largest pay increase for our educators in the United States. And I believe that that is long, long overdue. I think it is true for nursing staff, as well. And Iím glad that weíve now passed new measures."
2019-07-31,Inslee,And Iím glad that weíve increased our union membership 10%.
2019-07-31,Inslee,So unions can stand up for women as well.
2019-07-31,Booker,"Well, first of all, I want to say very clearly that I will not do foreign policy by tweet as Donald Trump seems to do all the time. A guy that literally tweets out that weíre pulling our troops out before his generals even know about it, is creating a dangerous situation for our troops in places like Afghanistan. And so I will bring our troops home and I will bring them home as quickly as possible. But I will not set, during a campaign, an artificial deadline. I will make sure we do it, we do it expeditiously. We do it safely to not create a vacuum thatís ultimately going to destabilize the Middle East and, perhaps, create the environment for terrorism and for extremism to threaten our nation."
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"This is real in a way thatís very difficult to convey in words. I was deployed to Iraq in 2005, during the height of the war, where I served in a field medical unit where every single day I saw the high cost of war. Just this past week, two more of our soldiers were killed in Afghanistan. My cousin is deployed to Afghanistan right now. Nearly 300 of our Hawaii National Guard soldiers are deployed to Afghanistan. 14,000 service members are deployed there. This is not about arbitrary deadlines. This is about leadership. The leadership I will bring to do the right thing, to bring our troops home within the first year in office. Because they shouldnít have been there this long. For too long weíve had leaders who have been arbitrating foreign policy from ivory towers in Washington without any idea about the cost and the consequence, the toll that it takes on our service members, on their families. We have to do the right thing, end these wasteful regime-change wars, and bring our troops home."
2019-07-31,Yang,"I would move to deescalate tensions in Iran, because theyíre responding to the fact that weíve pulled out of this agreement. And it wasnít just us and Iran, there were many other world powers that were part of that multilateral agreement. Weíd have to try and reenter that agreement, renegotiate the timelines, because the timelines now donít make as much sense. But Iíve signed a pledge to end the forever wars. Right now our strength abroad reflects our strength at home. Whatís happened, really? Weíve fallen apart at home so we elected Donald Trump and now we have this erratic and unpredictable relationship with even our longstanding partners and allies. What we have to do is we have to start investing those resources to solve the problem right here at home. Weíve spent trillions of dollars and lost thousands of American lives in conflicts that had unclear benefits. Weíve been in a constant state of war for 18 years. This is not what the American people want. I would bring the troops home. I would deescalate tensions with Iran. And I would start investing our resources in our own communities."
2019-07-31,Inslee,"Well, I think that these are matters of great and often difficult judgment and there is no sort of primer for presidents to read. We have to determine whether a potential president has adequate judgment in these decisions. I was only one of two members on this panel today who were called to make a judgment about the Iraq war. I was a relatively new member of Congress and I made the right judgment, because it was obvious to me that George Bush was fanning the flames of war. Now we face similar situations where we recognize we have a president whoíd be willing to beat the drums of war. We need a president who can stand up against the drums of war and make rational decisions. That was the right vote and I believe it."
2019-07-31,Biden,"I did make a bad judgment trusting the president saying he was only doing this to get inspectors in and get the UN to agree to put inspectors in. From the moment Shock and Awe started, from that moment, I was opposed to the effort and I was outspoken as much as anyone at all in the congress and the administration. Secondly, I was asked by the president in the first meeting we had on Iraq. He turned and said, ìJoe, get our combat troops out.î In front of the entire national security team. One of the proudest moments of my life was to stand there in Al-Faw Palace and tell everyone that weíre coming, all our combat troops are coming, home."
2019-07-31,Biden,"I opposed the surge in Afghanistan. This is long overdue. We should have not, in fact, gone into Afghanistan."
2019-07-31,Biden,Ö The way.
2019-07-31,de Blasio,Mr. Vice President.
2019-07-31,Biden,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I want to bring inÖ"
2019-07-31,Biden,"I would like to bring in the person on the stage who served in Iraq. Governor, Iím sorry, Congresswoman Gabbard, your response to what Vice President Biden just said?"
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"We were all lied to. This is the betrayal. This is the betrayal to the American people, to me, to my fellow service members. We were all lied to, told that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, was working with Al-Qaeda, and that this posed a threat to the American people. So I enlisted after 9/11 to protect our country. To go after those who attacked us on that fateful day, who took the lives of thousands of Americans. The problem is that this current president is continuing to betray us. We were supposed to be going after Al-Qaeda. But over years now not only have we not gone after Al-Qaeda, who is stronger today than they were in 9/11, our president is supporting Al-Qaeda."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,We still didnít talk about Iran.
2019-07-31,de Blasio,We didnít talk about Iran.
2019-07-31,de Blasio,Because weíre on the march to war in Iran right now and we blew by it.
2019-07-31,de Blasio,I respect the rules.
2019-07-31,de Blasio,But we-
2019-07-31,de Blasio,Have to stop this-
2019-07-31,de Blasio,Ö March to war in Iran.
2019-07-31,de Blasio,And the Democratic party has to stand up for it.
2019-07-31,Harris,"Well, I would never direct the Department of Justice to do whatever it believes it should do. But listen, look, we all watched his testimony. I read the report. There are 10 clear incidents of obstruction of justice by this president and he needs to be held accountable. Iíve seen people go to prison for far less. And the reality of it is that we have a person in the White House right now who has been shielded by a memo in the United States Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be indicted. I believe the American people are right to say there should be consequence and accountability for everyone and no one is above the law, including the President of the United States,"
2019-07-31,Booker,"My response is exactly that. Iíve read the report, Iíve read the redacted versions of the report. We have something that is astonishing going on the United States of America. We have a president that is not acting like the leader of the free world. Heís acting like an authoritarian against the actual Constitution that he swore an oath to uphold. And so this is a difference with a lot of us on this debate stage. I believe that we, in the United States Congress, should start impeachment proceedings immediately. And Iíll tell you this, Debbie Stabenow has joined my call for starting impeachment proceedings. Because he is now stonewalling congress, not allowing or subjecting himself to the checks and balances. We swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. The politics of this be damned. When we look back in history at what happened when a President of the United States started acting more like an authoritarian leader than the leader of the free world, the question is what will we have done? And I believe the congress should do its job."
2019-07-31,Castro,"Well, I agree. I was the first of the candidates to call on congress to begin impeachment proceedings. There are 10 different instances that Robert Mueller has pointed out where this president either obstructed justice or attempted to obstruct justice. And I believe that they should go forward with impeachment proceedings. As to the question of what my Department of Justice would do, I agree with those who say that a president should not direct an attorney general specifically to prosecute or not prosecute. However, I believe that the evidence is plain and clear and that if it gets that far that youíre likely to see a prosecution of Donald Trump."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"I think itís obvious at this point in our history that the president has committed the crimes worthy of impeachment. But I want to caution my fellow Democrats, while we move in every way we can for impeachment, we have to remember at the same time the American people are out there looking for us to do something for them in their lives. And what they see when they turn on the TV or go online is just talk about impeachment. We need more talk about working people and their lives. For example, are we really ready? And I ask people on this stage this question, are we ready to make sure that the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes? Thatís something every American wants to know about. Thatís something they want answers to right now. So yeah, move for impeachment. But donít forget to do the peopleís business and to stand up for working people. Because thatís how weíre actually going to beat Donald Trump. The best impeachment is beating him in the election of 2020."
2019-07-31,Bennet,"I think, look, as we go forward here we need to recognize a very practical reality which is that we are four months away. Weíve got the August recess, then we are four months away from the Iowa caucuses. And I just want to make sure whatever we do doesnít end up with an acquittal by Mitch McConnell in the Senate, which it surely would. And then President Trump would be running saying that he had been acquitted by the United States Congress. I believe we have a moral obligation to beat Donald Trump. He has to be a single-term president and we canít do anything that plays into his hands. We were talking earlier about climate up here, itís so important. Donald Trump should be the last climate denier thatís ever in the White House."
2019-07-31,Bennet,But we need to be smart about how-
2019-07-31,Bennet,Ö Weíre running or weíre going to give him a second term.
2019-07-31,Bennet,We canít do it.
2019-07-31,Castro,"Well, let me first say that I really do believe that we can walk and chew gum at the same time. All of us have a vision for the future of the country that weíre articulating to the American people. Weíre going to continue to do that. We have an election coming up. At the same time, senator, I think that too many folks in the senate and in the congress had been spooked by 1998. I believe that the times are different. And, in fact, I think that folks are making a mistake by not pursuing impeachment. The Mueller Report clearly details that he deserves it. And whatís going to happen in the Fall of next year, of 2020, if they donít impeach him itís easy to say, ìYou see? You see? The Democrats didnít go after me on impeachment. And you know why? Because I didnít do anything wrong. These folks that always investigate me, theyíre always trying to go after me. When it came down to it, they didnít go after me there because I didnít do anything wrong.î Conversely, if Mitch McConnell is the one that lets him off the hook, weíre going to be able to say-"
2019-07-31,Castro,"ìWell, sure. They impeached him in the house-"
2019-07-31,Castro,"Ö But his friend, Mitch McConnell, Moscow Mitch-"
2019-07-31,Castro,Ö Let him off the hook.î
2019-07-31,Bennet,"I donít disagree with that, you just said it better than I did. We have to walk and chew gum at the same time. It is incredibly unusual for members of Congress to be able to do that. And Iím glad that Secretary Castro has the ambition-"
2019-07-31,Castro,"Well my brother can, heís here tonight."
2019-07-31,Bennet,"Thatís what I was going to say, itís your brother thatís giving you that good feeling about the congress. Thatís what we should do."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"Thank you. For the last three years, weíve watched Donald Trump pit working people against each other, black versus white, citizen versus immigrant, and why? So that the wealthy and the powerful he represents can hold the American dream hostage from everyone else. We canít let them get away with it. If weíre going to beat Donald Trump, this has to be a party that stands for something."
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"This has to be the party of labor unions. This has to be the party of universal health care. This has to be the party thatís not afraid to say out loud weíre going to tax the hell out of the wealthy. And when we do that, Donald Trump, right on cue will call us socialists. Well, hereís what Iíll say to him, ìDonald, youíre the real socialist. The problem is itís socialism for the rich.î"
2019-07-31,de Blasio,"We here in this country, we donít have to take that anymore. We can fight back. If you agree that we can stand up to Donald Trump and we can stand up to the wealthy, then go to taxthehell.com and join us so we can build a country that puts working people first."
2019-07-31,Bennet,"Thank you. Thank you very much. What I want to say to all of you tonight is we have been here before as a country. We have faced challenges that weíve actually even forget some of us tonight how hard the people fought, how hard they work, how hard they organized the votes, they had to take the people they had to get to the polls to make this country more democratic, more fair and more free. And now we have a person in the White House who has no appreciation of that history, who doesnít believe in the rule of law, who doesnít believe in the independence of the judiciary, who doesnít believe that climate change is real."
2019-07-31,Bennet,"I think that we have an incredible opportunity in front of us, all of us, to come together just as our parents and grandparents did before them and face challenges even harder than the ones that we face. But the only way weíre going to be able to do it is to put the divisive politics of Donald Trump behind us, and the divisive politics of the last 10 years behind us. We need to come together united against a broken Washington, make Donald Trump a one term President, and begin to govern this country again for our kids and our grandkids who cannot do it for themselves."
2019-07-31,Bennet,We have to do it for them. Please join me at michaelbennet.com thanks for being here tonight.
2019-07-31,Inslee,"For decades we have kicked the can down the road on climate change. And now under Donald Trump we faced a looming catastrophe, but it is not too late. We have one last chance. And when you have one chance in life, you take it. Think about this, literally the survival of humanity on this planet in civilization as we know it is in the hands of the next president. And we have to have a leader who will do what is necessary to save us."
2019-07-31,Inslee,"And that includes making this the top priority of the next Presidency. And I alone on this panel am making a commitment that this will be the organizing principle of my administration, not the first day, but every day. And if you share my view of the urgency of this matter, I hope youíll join me because we are up against powerful special fossil fuel interests. And it is time to stand up on our legs and confront the fossil fuels special interests because that is our salvation, what it depends upon."
2019-07-31,Inslee,So I hope you will consider going to jayinslee.com and joining this effort. And I will close with this. I am confident and optimistic tonight even in the face of this difficulty because I know we can build a clean energy economy. I know we can save our children and our grandchildren. I know that we can defeat climate change. And we will defeat Donald Trump. This is our moral responsibility and we will fulfill it. Thank you very much.
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"Donald Trump has really torn apart the moral fabric of this country dividing us on every racial line, every religious line, every socioeconomic line he can find. Iím running for president because I want to help people. And I actually have the experience and the ability to do that. Iíve brought Congress together and actually made a difference in peopleís lives. I also know how to beat Donald Trump. He has broken his promises to the American people."
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"Iíve taken this fight directly to his backyard in Michigan, and Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and Iíll go to all the places in this country. I will fight for your family. Doesnít matter who you are. It doesnít matter where you live. It doesnít matter who you love because thatís my responsibility. And Iíve done this before. I started out in a two to one Republican district. I won it twice. Iíve never lost an election since."
2019-07-31,Gillibrand,"And I not only bring people together electorally, but also legislatively. I get things done. So we need a president who is not afraid of the big challenges of the big fights. There is no false choice. We donít need a liberal or progressive with big ideas, or we donít need a moderate who can win back Trump-Obama voters. You need someone who can do both. And thatís who I am. Please go to kirstengillibrand.com so I can make the next debate stage."
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"Thank you. Donald Trump and warmongering politicians in Washington have failed us. They continue to escalate tensions with other nuclear-armed countries like Russia, and China, and North Korea, starting a new Cold War, pushing us closer and closer to the brink of nuclear catastrophe. Now as we stand here tonight, there are thousands of nuclear missiles pointed at us. And if we were to get an attack right here tonight, you would have 30 minutes, 30 minutes before we were hit."
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"And you would receive an alert like the one we received in Hawaii last year that would say incoming missile. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill. And you would see as we did, as my loved ones in Hawaii did, there is no shelter. This is the warmongers hoax. There is no shelter. Itís all a lie. As president, I will end this insanity because it doesnít have to be this way."
2019-07-31,Gabbard,"I will end these wasteful regime change wars. Work to end this new Cold War through the use of diplomacy to deescalate these tensions. And take the trillions of dollars that weíve been wasting on these wars and on these weapons, and redirect those resources into serving the needs of our people right here at home. Things like healthcare for all, making sure everyone in this country has clean water to drink and clean air to breathe, investing in education, investing in our infrastructure. The needs are great. As your president, I will put your interests above all else."
2019-07-31,Castro,"Well, first of all let me say thank you to you, Jake, Dana, and to Don, and to everybody here, and to those watching. This election is all about what kind of nation weíre going to become. You and I, we stand on the shoulders of folks who have made beds and made sacrifices. People that fought in wars, and fought discrimination, folks that pick crops, and stood in picket lines. And they helped build the wonderful nation that we live in today."
2019-07-31,Castro,"Donald Trump has not been bashful in his cruelty. And Iím not going to be bashful in my common sense and compassion. I believe that we need leadership that understands that we need to move forward as one nation with one destiny. And our destiny in the years to come is to be the smartest, the healthiest, the fairest, and the most prosperous nation on earth. If you want to help me build that America for the future, I hope youíll go to juliancastro.com. And on January 20th, 2021 weíll say together, ìAdios,î to Donald Trump."
2019-07-31,Yang,"You know what the talking heads couldnít stop talking about after the last debate? Itís not the fact that Iím somehow number four on this stage in national polling. It was the fact that I wasnít wearing a tie. Instead of talking about automation and our future, including the fact that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs, hundreds of thousands right here in Michigan. Weíre up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines playing roles in this reality TV show. Itís one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our President."
2019-07-31,Yang,"We need to be laser focused on solving the real challenges of today, like the fact that the most common job jobs in America may not exist in a decade. Or, that most Americans cannot pay their bills. My flagship proposal, the Freedom Dividend, would put $1,000 a month into the hands of every American adult, be a game changer for millions of American families. If you care more about your family and your kids than my neckwear, enter your zip code at yang2020.com, and see what $1,000 a month would mean to your community. I have done the math. Itís not left. Itís not right. Itís forward. And that is how weíre going to beat Donald Trump in 2020."
2019-07-31,Booker,"Thank you. First, I just want to give a lot of thanks to the city of Detroit. Theyíre hosting us today. And one of the reasons I respect this city is because it has the kind of defiant love that I find in many American cities, including the city of Newark. And Detroit is turning around. And Newark is turning around because we let no one divide us, no one demean or degrade us, or underestimate our worth. We pulled together and fought for common purpose and common cause."
2019-07-31,Booker,"Thatís the history of this city. My mom is sitting there who was born in the city of Detroit, born to a guy that was a UAW worker. My grandfather who pulled his family out of poverty in the Depression. My grandmother joined him. She was really entrepreneurial, opened a pool hall and a laundry mat right here in this city. That is the American dream. And so many of us have stories like that. But the dream of this country is under threat right now."
2019-07-31,Booker,"Well, my momís generation, 80, 95% of baby boomers did better than their parents. Itís now just a coin toss for millennials. We have a real crises in our country. And the crises is Donald Trump, but not only Donald Trump. I have a frustration that sometimes people are saying the only thing they want is to beat Donald Trump. Well, that is the floor, and not the ceiling."
2019-07-31,Booker,"The way we beat Donald Trump is not just focusing on him. He wants to take all the oxygen out of the room. Itís when we start focusing on each other, and understanding that our common bonds, and our common purpose to address our common pain is what has saved us before. Itís whatís gonna save us now. That is the kind of leader that I am going to be as President of the United States. Not just uniting the Democratic Party, but making sure that we put more indivisible back into this one nation under God. And if you believe like I do, please go to corybooker.com and join the mission."
2019-07-31,Harris,"So in my background as Attorney General of California, I took on the big banks who preyed on the homeowners, many of whom lost their homes and will never be able to buy another. Iíve taken on the for profit colleges who preyed on students, put them out of business. Iíve preyed on transnational criminal organizations that have preyed on women and children. And I will tell you, we have a predator living in the White House."
2019-07-31,Harris,"And Iím going to tell you something. Donald Trump has predatory nature and predatory instincts. And the thing about predators is this, by their very nature, they prey on people they perceive to be weak. They prey on people they perceive to be vulnerable. They prey on people who are in need of help, often desperate for help. And predators are cowards. What we need is someone who is going to be on that debate stage with Donald Trump and defeat him by being able to prosecute the case against four more years."
2019-07-31,Harris,"And let me tell you, weíve got a long rap sheet. Weíre looking at someone who passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations in this country when he said he would help working families. Weíve got a person who was put babies in cages and separated children from their parents. We have someone who passed his so-called trade policy that was trade policy by tweet and has resulted in a tax on American families."
2019-07-31,Harris,"So we must defeat him. And then in turning the page, write the next chapter for our country. And that has to be written in a way that recognizes what wakes people up at three oíclock in the morning. And that is my agenda. The 3:00 AM agenda that is focused on getting folks the jobs they need, getting their children the education they need, making sure they have the healthcare they need, and the future they deserve. So please join me at kamalaharris.org and I thank you for your time."
2019-07-31,Biden,"Thank you. Thank you very much. And thank you Mr. Mayor for Detroit hosting this. Look, Iíve said it many times and I think everyone agrees with this. Weíre in a battle for the soul of America. This is the most consequential election any one of you no matter how old or young you are has ever, ever participate in. Four more years of Donald Trump will go down as an aberration. Hard to overcome the damage heís done, but we can overcome it."
2019-07-31,Biden,"Eight more years of Donald Trump will change America in a fundamental way. The America we know will no longer exist. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. We have to let them know who we are. We choose science over fiction. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. And we choose. We choose the idea that we can as Americans, when we act together, do anything. This is the United States of America. Weíve acted together. We have never, never, never been unable to overcome whatever the problem was. If you agree with me, go to Joe30330 and help me in this fight. Thank you very much."
2019-07-30,Williamson,"Thank you. In 1776 our founders brought forth on this planet an extraordinary new possibility. It was the idea that people, no matter who they were, would simply have the possibility of thriving. We have not ever totally actualized this ideal, but at the times when we have done best, we have tried."
2019-07-30,Williamson,"And when forces have opposed them, generations of Americans have risen up and pushed back against those forces. We did that with abolition and with womenís suffrage and with civil rights and now it is time, a generation of Americans to rise up again."
2019-07-30,Williamson,"For an amoral economic system has turned short term profits for huge multinational corporations into a false god and this new false god takes precedence over the safety and the health and the wellbeing of we, the American people and the people of the world and the planet on which we live. Conventional politics will not solve this problem because conventional politics is part of the problem. We, the American people must rise up and do what we do best and create a new possibility. Say no to what we donít want and yes to what we know can be true."
2019-07-30,Williamson,Iím Marianne Williamson and thatís why Iím running for president.
2019-07-30,Delaney,"Folks, we have a choice. We can go down the road that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren want to take us with bad policies like Medicare for All, free everything and impossible promises thatíll turn off independent voters and get Trump reelected. Thatís what happened with McGovern. Thatís what happened with Mondale."
2019-07-30,Delaney,Thatís what happened with Dukakis. Or we can nominate someone with new ideas to create universal healthcare for every American with choice. Someone who wants to unify our country and grow the economy and create jobs everywhere and then we win the White House. Iím the product of the American Dream.
2019-07-30,Delaney,"I believe in it. Iím the grandson of immigrants, the son of a construction worker. My wife April, and I have four amazing daughters. I was the youngest CEO in the history of the New York Stock Exchange, created thousands of jobs and then served in Congress."
2019-07-30,Delaney,"Thatís the type of background and my platform is about real solutions, not impossible promises that can beat Trump and govern. Thank you."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"Letís get real. Tonight we debate, but ultimately we have to beat Donald Trump. My background, itís a little different than his. I stand before you today as a granddaughter of an iron ore miner, as a daughter of a union teacher and a newspaper man."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"As the first woman elected to the US Senate from the state of Minnesota and a candidate for president of the United States. Thatís because we come from a country of shared dreams and I have had it with the racist attacks. I have had it with a president that says one thing on TV, that has your back and then you get home and you see those charges for prescription drugs and cable and college."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"Youíre going to hear a lot of promises up here, but Iím going to tell you this. Yes, I have bold ideas, but they are grounded in reality and yes, I will make some simple promises. I can win this. Iím from the Midwest and I have won every race, every place, every time, and I will govern with integrity, the integrity worthy of the extraordinary people of this nation."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,Iím running for president because our country is running out of time. It is even bigger than the emergency of the Trump presidency. Ask yourself how somebody like Donald Trump ever gets within cheating distance as the Oval Office in the first place. It doesnít happen unless America is already in a crisis.
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"An economy thatís not working for everyone, endless war, climate change. We have lived this. In my industrial Midwestern hometown, my generation has lived this as long as we have been alive. And itís only accelerated. Science tells us we have 12 years before we reach the horizon of catastrophe when it comes to our climate."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"By 2030 the average house in this country will cost half a million bucks and a womanís right to choose may not even exist. Weíre not going to be able to meet this moment by recycling the same arguments, policies, and politicians that have dominated Washington for as long as I have been alive."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,Weíve got to summon the courage to walk away from the past and do something different. This is our shot. That is why Iím running for president.
2019-07-30,Warren,"Donald Trump disgraces the office of president every single day. And anyone on this stage tonight or tomorrow night would be a far better president. I promise no matter who our candidate is, I will work my heart out to beat Donald Trump and to elect a democratic Congress, but all problems didnít start with Donald Trump."
2019-07-30,Warren,"Donald Trump is part of a corrupt, rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else. Weíre not going to solve the urgent problems that we face with small ideas and spinelessness. Weíre going to solve them by being the Democratic Party of big structural change."
2019-07-30,Warren,"We need to be the party that fights for our democracy and our economy to work for everyone. I know whatís broken in this country. I know how to fix it, and I will fight to make it happen."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Tonight, in America as we speak, 87 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured, but the healthcare industry made a $100 billion in profits last year. Tonight, as we speak right now, 500,000 Americans are sleeping out on the street, and yet companies like Amazon that made billions in profits, did not pay one nickel in federal income tax."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Tonight, half of the American people are living paycheck to paycheck, and yet 49% of all new income goes to the top 1%. Tonight, the fossil fuel industry continues to receive 100s of billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks while they destroy this planet."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"We have got to take on Trumpís racism, his sexism, xenophobia, and come together in an unprecedented grassroots movement to not only defeat Trump, but to transform our economy and our government."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Youíre wrong. Right now we have a dysfunctional healthcare system, 87 million uninsured or under-insured, 500,000 Americans every year going bankrupt because of medical bills. 30,000 people dying while the healthcare industry makes tens of billions of dollars in profit."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Five minutes away from here John is a country. Itís called Canada. They guarantee health care to every man, woman, and child as a human right. They spend half of what we spent. And by the way, when you end up in a hospital in Canada, you come out with no bill at all. Healthcare is a human right, not a privilege."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"I believe that, I will fight for that."
2019-07-30,Delaney,"Well, Iím right about this. We can create a universal healthcare system to give everyone basic healthcare for free and I have a proposal to do it. But we donít have to go around and be the party of subtraction and telling half the country who has private health insurance that their health insurance is illegal."
2019-07-30,Delaney,"My Dad, the union electrician, loved the healthcare he got from the IBEW. He would never want someone to take that away. Half of Medicare beneficiaries now have Medicare advantage, which is private insurance or supplemental plans. Itís also bad policy. Itíll underfund the industry."
2019-07-30,Delaney,Many hospitals will close and itís bad policy.
2019-07-30,Warren,My name was also mentioned in this-
2019-07-30,Sanders,"The fact of the matter is tens of millions of people lose their health insurance every single year when they change jobs, when their employer changes that insurance. If you want stability in the health care system, if you want a system which gives you freedom of choice with regard to doctor or hospital."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Which is a system which will not bankrupt you, the answer is to get rid of the profiteering of the drug companies-"
2019-07-30,Sanders,And the insurance companies-
2019-07-30,Sanders,Ö [crosstalk 00:15:02]-
2019-07-30,Warren,[crosstalk 00:15:03].
2019-07-30,Delaney,"But now heís talking about a different issue. What Iím talking about is really simple. We should deal with the tragedy of the uninsured and give everyone healthcare as a right, but why do we got to be the party of taking something away from?"
2019-07-30,Warren,No. No one is the party-
2019-07-30,Delaney,Thatís what theyíre running on. Theyíre running on telling half the country that your health insurance is illegal. It says it right in the bill. We donít have to do that. We can give everyone healthcare and allow people to have choice. Thatís the American way.
2019-07-30,Warren,"So look, letís be clear about this. We are the Democrats. We are not about trying to take away healthcare from anyone. Thatís what the Republicans are trying to do and we should stop using Republican talking points in order to talk with each other about how to best provide that health care."
2019-07-30,Warren,"Now, I want to have a chance to tell the story about my friend Eddie Barkat. Eddie is 35 years old. He has a wife, Rachel. He has a cute little boy named Carl. He also has ALS and itís killing him. And he has health insurance, good health insurance-"
2019-07-30,Warren,And itís not nearly enough. [crosstalk 00:16:11] important-
2019-07-30,Warren,All right.
2019-07-30,Warren,"So giant corporations and billionaires are going to pay more. Middle class families are going to pay less out of pocket for their health care. And Iíd like to finish talking about Eddie, the guy who has ALS. This isnít funny. This is somebody who has health insurance and is dying. And every month he has about $9,000 in medical bills that his insurance company wonít cover."
2019-07-30,Warren,"His wife, Rachel is on the phone for hours and hours and hours begging the insurance company, ìPlease cover what the doctors say he needs.î He talks about what itís like to go online with thousands of other people to beg friends, family and strangers for money so he can cover his medical expenses."
2019-07-30,Warren,The basic model of an insurance company has taken as much money as you can in premiums and pay out as little as possible in health care coverage. That is not working-
2019-07-30,Warren,Ö for American across this country-
2019-07-30,Warren,Medicare for All will fix that and thatís why I will fight for it.
2019-07-30,Warren,"Costs will go up for billionaires and go up for corporations. For middle class families, cost-"
2019-07-30,Warren,"And go up for corporations. For middle class families, total costs will go down."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"So, we donít have to stand up here speculating about whether the public option or a Medicare for All environment will be better than the corporate options. We can put it to the test. Thatís the concept of my Medicare for All who want to proposal. That way, if people like me are right that the public alternative is going to be not only more comprehensive but more affordable than any of the corporate options around there, weíll see Americans walk away from the corporate options into that Medicare option and it will become Medicare for All without us having to kick anybody off. [crosstalk 00:19:28]"
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,I think you can buy into it. Thatís the idea of Medicare for All who want it.
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"Look, this is a distinction without a difference whether youíre paying the same money in the form of taxes or premiums. Look. In this country, if you have health coverageÖ If you donít have health coverage, youíre paying too much for care. And if you do have health coverage, youíre paying too much for the care. [crosstalk 00:19:56]"
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"That is incorrect. I just have a better way to do this. And in one of my first debates, Jake, I was called a street fighter from the iron range by my opponent. And when she said it, I said, ìThank you.î So, this is what I think we need to get done. We need the public option. Thatís what Barack Obama wanted, and it would bring healthcare costs down for everyone. And by the way, I just donít buy this. Iíve heard some of these candidates say that itís somehow not moral to not have that public option. Well, Senator Sanders was actually on a public option bill last year and that was, Bernie, the Medicaid public option bill that Senator Schatz introduced. Clearly, this is the easiest way to move forward quickly, and I want to get things done. People canít wait. Iíve got my friend, Nicole, out there whose son was actually died trying to ration his insulin as a restaurant manager and he died because he didnít have the enough money to pay for it. And Bernie and I have worked on pharmaceutical [inaudible 00:23:23] together, and we can get that expensive- [crosstalk 00:23:25]"
2019-07-30,Sanders,"As the author of the Medicare bill, let me clear up one thing. If People talk about how the insurance, there are millions of people have insurance, they canít go to the doctor. And when they come out of the hospital, they go bankrupt. All right? What I am talking about and others up here are talking about is no deductibles and no co-payments. And Jake, your question is a Republican talking point. At the end of the dayÖ And by the way, the healthcare industry will be advertising tonight on this program."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Oh. Could I complete that, please?"
2019-07-30,Sanders,They will be advertising tonight with that talking point.
2019-07-30,Warren,"So, we have to think of this in terms of the big frame. Whatís the problem in Washington? It works great for the wealthy. It works great for those who can hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers, and it keeps working great for the insurance companies and the drug companies. What itís going to take is real courage to fight back against them. These insurance companies do not have a god given right to make $23 billion in profits and suck it out of our healthcare system. They do not have a god given right to put forms in place so that people cannotÖ They want to deny coverage. [crosstalk 00:24:50]"
2019-07-30,Delaney,"Iím the only one on the stage who actually has experience in the healthcare business. And with all due respect, I donít think my colleagues understand the business. We have the public option, which is great. [crosstalk 00:25:02]"
2019-07-30,Sanders,Itís not a business.
2019-07-30,Delaney,"The public option is great, but it doesnít go far enough. It doesnít go far enough. Iím proposing universal healthcare where everyone gets healthcare as a basic human right for free, but they have choices. My plan, better care is fully paid for without raising middle-class tax options. So, when we think about this debate, thereís Medicare for All, which is extreme. [crosstalk 00:25:24]"
2019-07-30,Delaney,I was interrupted. One more thing.
2019-07-30,Warren,"We have tried this experiment with the insurance companies, and what theyíve done is theyíve sucked billions of dollars out of our healthcare system and they force people to have to fight to try to get the healthcare coverage that their doctors and nurses say that they need. Why does everybodyÖ Why does every doctorÖ Why does every hospital have to fill out so many complicated forms? Itís because it gives insurance companies a chance to say no and to push that cost back on the patients. Thatís what we have to fight."
2019-07-30,Williamson,"I donít know if Senator Warren said that about me, specifically. I admire very much what Senator Warren has said and what Bernie has said, but I have to say I haveÖ Iím normally way over there with Bernie and Elizabeth on this one. I hear the others and I have some concern about that as well, and I do have concern about what the Republicans would say and thatís not just a Republican talking point. I do have concern that it will be difficult. I have concerns that it will make it harder to win and I have a concern that it will make it harder to govern because if thatís our big fight, then the Republicans will so shut us down on everything else. [crosstalk 00:27:26]"
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"It is time to stop worrying about what the Republicans will say. Look, if itís true that if we embrace a far left agenda, theyíre going to say weíre a bunch of crazy socialists. If we embrace a conservative agenda, you know what theyíre going to do? Theyíre going to say weíre a bunch of crazy socialists. So, letís just stand up for the right policy, go out there and defend it. Thatís the policy Iím putting forward, not because I think itís the right triangulation between Republicans here and Democrats there, because I think itís the right answer for people like my mother-in-law who is here whose life was saved by the ACA, but who was still far too vulnerable to the fact that the insurance industry does not care about her health. [crosstalk 00:28:04]"
2019-07-30,Sanders,"letís be clear what this debate is about. Nobody can defend the dysfunctionality of the current system. What we are taking on is the fact that over the last 20 years, the drug companies and the insurance companies have spent four and a half billion dollars of your health insurance money on lobbying and campaign contributions. That is why when I went to Canada the other day, people paid 1/10 the price in Canada for insulin that theyíre paying in the United States."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Well, two things. They will be better because Medicare for All is comprehensive. It covers all healthcare needs. For senior citizens, it will finally include dental care, hearing aids and eyeglasses. [crosstalk 00:11:53]"
2019-07-30,Sanders,Second of allÖ
2019-07-30,Sanders,"I do know it. I wrote the damn bill. And second of all, many of our union brothers and sisters, nobody more pro-union than me up here, are now paying high deductibles and co-payments. And when we do Medicare for All, instead of having the company putting money into healthcare, they can get decent wage increases, which theyíre not getting today. [crosstalk 00:30:21]"
2019-07-30,Delaney,"So, the bill that Senator Sanders drafted by definition will lower quality in healthcare because it says specifically that the rates will be the same as current Medicare rates, and the data is clear. Medicare does not cover the cost of healthcare. It covers 80% of the cost of healthcare in this country, and private insurance covers 120%. So, if you start underpaying all the healthcare providers, youíre going to create a two-tier market where wealthy people buy their healthcare with cash and the people who are forced, like my dad, the union electrician, will have that healthcare plan taken away from him. They will be forced into and underfunded- [crosstalk 00:31:32]"
2019-07-30,Sanders,"All right. On the Medicare for All, the hospitals will save substantial sums of money because theyíre not going to be spending a fortune doing billing and the other bureaucratic things that they have to do today. [crosstalk 00:31:46]"
2019-07-30,Delaney,Iíve done the math. It doesnít add up.
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Second of all, maybe you did that and made money off of healthcare, but our job is for a nonprofit healthcare system. Furthermore, when we say $500-billion a year by ending all of the incredible complexities that are driving every American crazy, trying to deal with the health insurance companies, hospitals will be better off than they are today. [crosstalk 00:32:09]"
2019-07-30,Delaney,"Listen. His math is wrong. Thatís all Iím saying, that his math is wrong. Itís been well-documented that if all the bills were paid at Medicare rate, which is specificallyÖ I think itís in section 1200 of their bill, then many hospitals in this country would close. Iíve been going around rural America and I ask rural hospital administrators one question. î If all your bills were paid at the Medicare rate last year, what would happen?î And they all look at me and say, ìWe would close.î But the question is, why do we have to be so extreme? Why canít we just give everyone healthcare as a right and allow them to have choice? Iím starting to think this is not about healthcare. This is an anti-private sector strategy. [crosstalk 00:32:47]"
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"When Iím President, illegally crossing the border will still be illegal. We can argue over the finer points of which parts of this ought to be handled by civil law and which parts ought to be handled by criminal law, but weíve got a crisis on our hands. And itís not just a crisis of immigration. Itís a crisis of cruelty and incompetence that has created a humanitarian disaster on our southern border. It is a stain on the United States of America."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"Americans want comprehensive immigration reform and frankly, weíve been talking about the same framework for my entire adult lifetime. Protections for dreamers, making sure that that we have a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented, cleaning up lawful immigration. We know what to do. We know the border security can be part of that package and we can still be a nation of laws. The problem is we havenít had the will to get it done in Washington, and now we have a president who could fix it in a month because there is that bipartisan agreement, but he needs it to be a crisis rather than an achievement. That will end on my wall."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"So, in my view, if fraud is involved, then thatís suitable for the criminal statute. If not, then it should be handled under civil law. These show of hands are exactly what is wrong with the way that this race is being- [crosstalk 00:34:32]"
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,We appreciate that.
2019-07-30,Warren,"So, the problem is that right now, the criminalization statute is what gives Donald Trump the ability to take children away from their parents. Itís what gives him the ability to lock up people at our borders. We need to continue to have border security and we can do that, but what we canít do is not live our values. Iíve been down to the border. I have seen the mothers. I have seen the cages of babies. We must be a country that everyday lives our values, and that means we cannot make it a crime when someone comes here. [crosstalk 00:36:02]"
2019-07-30,Warren,Ö cannot make it a crime when someone comes here.
2019-07-30,Warren,Yes.
2019-07-30,Warren,The point is not about criminalization. That has given Donald Trump the tool to break families apart.
2019-07-30,Warren,We need-
2019-07-30,Warren,"Well, and one way to fix it is to decriminalize. Thatís the whole point. What weíre looking for here is a way to take away the tools-"
2019-07-30,Warren,Ö that Donald Trump has used to break up families.
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"I would say there is the will to change this in Congress. Whatís missing is the right person in the White House. I believe that immigrants donít diminish America, they are America. And if you want to do something about border security, you first of all change the rules so people can seek asylum in those northern triangle countries. Then you pass the bill, and what the bill will do is itíll greatly reduce the deficit and give us some money for border security and for help processing the cases. And most of all, it will allow for a path to citizenship. Because this is not just about the border."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,Donald Trump wants to use these people as political pawns-
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,Ö when we have people all over our country that simply want to work and obey the law.
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Because weíll have the strong border protections. But the main point I want to make is that what Trump is doing through his racism and his xenophobia is demonizing a group of people. And as president, I will end that demonization. If a mother and a child walk thousands of miles on a dangerous path, in my view, they are not criminals. They are people fleeing violence."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"And I think the main thing that weíve got to do, among many others, and Beto made this point, weíve got to ask ourselves why are people walking 2,000 miles to a strange country where they donít know the language? So, what we will do the first week we are in the White House is bring the entire hemisphere together, to talk about how we rebuild Hondouras-"
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Ö Guatemala, and El Salvador so people do not have to flee their own countries."
2019-07-30,Warren,Iíd just like to add on this.
2019-07-30,Warren,"I think that what we have to do, is we have to be an America that is clear about what we want to do with immigration. We need to expand legal immigration. We need to create a path for citizenship. Not just for dreamers, but for grandmas and for people who have been working here in the farms and for students who have overstayed their visas. We need to fix the prices at the border."
2019-07-30,Warren,"And a big part of how we do that is we do not play into Donald Trumpís hands. He wants to stir up the crisis at the border, because thatís his overall message. Itís, if thereís anything wrong in your life, blame them."
2019-07-30,Warren,"What youíre saying is ignore the law. Laws matter. And it matters if we say our law is that we will lock people up who come here seeking refuge, who come here seeking asylum. That is not a crime. And as Americans, what we need to do is have a sane system that keeps us safe at the border, but not criminalize the-"
2019-07-30,Warren,Ö activity of a mother fleeing here for safety.
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Well, two things. A sane immigration policy moves the comprehensive immigration reform. It moves to humane border policy, in which by the way, we have enough administrative judges so that we donít have incredible backlogs that we have right now."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"But to answer your question, I happen to believe that when I talk about healthcare, it is a human right that applies to all people in this country. And under a Medicare for all single-payer system, we could afford to do that."
2019-07-30,Williamson,"Everything that weíre talking about here tonight is whatís wrong with American politics. And the Democratic Party needs to understand that we should be the party that talks not just about symptoms, but also about causes. When weíre talking about healthcare, we need to talk about more than just the healthcare plan. We need to realize we have a sickness care rather than a healthcare system. We need to be the party talking about why so many of our chemical policies and our food policies and our agricultural policies and our environmental policies and even our economic policies are leading for people getting sick to begin with."
2019-07-30,Williamson,Thatís what the DemocraticÖ But I want to say more about immigration-
2019-07-30,Williamson,Okay.
2019-07-30,Williamson,I hope youíll come back to me this time.
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"Well, this epidemic of gun violence has hit my community, too, far too many times. Thatís the worst part of being Mayor, getting the phone call, consoling grieving parents. We have a mass shootings worth of killings everyday in this country."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"What weíre doing hasnít worked, because we havenít had a system in Washington capable of delivering what the American people have told us they want. 90% of Republicans want universal background checks, not to mention the common sense solutions like red flag laws that disarm domestic abusers and flag mental health risks. And an end to assault weapons, things like what I carried overseas in uniform, that have no business in American neighborhoods in peacetime, let alone anywhere near a school."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"I was at an event a few days ago, and a 13 year old asked me what we were going to do about school safety, and then began shaking, and then began crying. And we could talk about these policies, but we already know the policies. The only thing I could think of looking into the eyes of this child is, weíre supposed to be dealing with this so you donít have to. High school is hard enough without having to worry about whether youíre going to get shot."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,And when 90% of Americans to happen-
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,Ö and Washington canít deliver-
2019-07-30,Warren,I disagree-
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,Ö we canít expect the same-
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,I disagree.
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,I disagree with his diagnosis of the problem.
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"Yes. This isnít just about a system, or itís not just about words. This is about the NRA. I sat across from the President of the United States after Parkland, because Iíve been a leader on these issues and have the bill to close the boyfriend loophole. And I watched and wrote down when nine times he said he wanted universal background checks. The next day, he goes and he meets with the NRA and he folds. As your president, I will not fold. I will make sure that we get universal background checks passed, the assault weapon ban, that we do something about magazines, and that we understand when that little six year old boy died, Steven Romero, when his dad said, ìHeís only six years old.î"
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,All I can say is heís six years old. We have to remember that.
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"This is the exact same conversation weíve been having since I was in high school. I was a junior when the Columbine shooting happened. I was part of the first generation that saw routine school shootings. We have now produced the second school shooting generation in this country. We dare not allow there to be a third. Something is broken. If it is even possible for the same debate around the same solutions that we all know are the right thing to doÖ They wonít prevent every incident, they wonít save every life, but we know what to do and it has not happened."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"Yes. What is broken is a political system that allows the NRA and other large big money to come in and make things not happen, when the majority of people are for. The people are with us now. After Parkland, those students just didnít march. They talked to their dads and their grandpas and the hunters in their family and they said, ìThere must be a better way.î Then we elected people in the House of Representatives, and guess what? It changed and they passed universal background checks. And now that bill is sitting on Mitch McConnellís doorstep because of the money and the power of the NRA. As president I will take them on."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,This is not about systems and words.
2019-07-30,Sanders,"I think we have got to doÖ I think what I meant is what President Obama said, and that nobody up here is going to tell you that we have the magical solution to the crisis. Now I come from one of the most rural states in America. I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA. And as president, I suspect it will be an F record."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"What I believe we have got to do is have the guts to finally take on the NRA. You asked me about my record. Back in 1988, coming from a state that had no gun control, I called for the ban of the sale and distribution of assault weapons. I lost that election. I will do everything I can, not only to take on the NRA, but to expand in great universal background checks, do away with the strong man provision, do away with the gun show loophole, and do away with the loopholes that now exist for gun manufacturers who are selling large amounts of weapons into communities that are going to gangs."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"Itís still the conversation that weíve been having for the last 20 years. Of course we need to get money of out politics, but when I propose the actual structural Democratic reforms that might make a difference, end the Electoral College, amend the Constitution if necessary to clear up Citizens United, have D.C. actually be a state and depoliticize the Supreme Court with structural reform, people look at me funny, as if this country were incapable of structural reform."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,Does anybody really think weíre going to overtake Citizens United without Constitutional action? This is a country that once changed its Constitution so you couldnít drink and then changed it back because we changed our minds about that.
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,And youíre telling me we canít reform our Democracy in our time?
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,We have to or weíll be having the same argument 20 years from now.
2019-07-30,Warren,Iíd like to have a chance on this.
2019-07-30,Williamson,"The issue of gun safety, of course, is that the NRA has us in a choke hold. But so do the pharmaceutical companies, so do the health insurance companies, so do the fossil fuel companies, and so do the defense contractors. And none of this will change until we either pass a Constitutional amendment or pass legislation that establishes public funding for federal campaigns."
2019-07-30,Williamson,"But for politicians, including my fellow candidates, who themselves have taken tens of thousands, in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars from these same corporate donors, to think that they now have the moral authority to say weíre going to take them on, I donít think the Democratic Party should be surprised that so many Americans believe yada, yada, yada. It is time for us to start over with people who have not taken donations from any of these corporations and can say with real moral authority, ìThat is over. We are going to establish public funding for federal campaigns.î Thatís what we need to stand up to. We need to have a Constitutional amendment, we need to have legislation to do it."
2019-07-30,Williamson,"And until we do it, itís just the same old."
2019-07-30,Warren,Iíd like to be heard in this.
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Well, the truth is that every credible poll that I have seen has me beating Donald Trump, including the battleground states of Michigan, where I won the Democratic Primary, Wisconsin, where I won the Democratic primary, and Pennsylvania. And the reason we are going to defeat Trump and beat him badly, is that he is a fraud and a phony, and weíre going to expose him for what he is."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"The American people want to have a minimum wage, which is a living wage, 15 bucks an hour. Iíve helped lead that effort. The American people want to pay reasonable prices for prescription drugs, not the highest prices in the world. Iíve helped lead the effort for that as well."
2019-07-30,Sanders,Okay.
2019-07-30,Sanders,John?
2019-07-30,Sanders,"John, I was a mayor, and I helped transform my city. I have some practical experience. Second of all, interestingly enough, today is the anniversary of Medicare. 54 years ago under Lyndon Johnson and a democratic congress, they started a new program. After one year, it had 19 million elderly people in it. Please donít tell me that, in a four year period, we cannot go from 65 down to 55 to 45 to 35. This is not radical. This is what virtually every other country on Earth does."
2019-07-30,Sanders,We are the odd guy out.
2019-07-30,Warren,"Well, it is my way of talking about I know how to fight and I know how to win. I took on giant banks and I beat them. I took on Wall Street and CEOs, and their lobbyists and their lawyers, and I beat them. I took on a popular Republican incumbent senator and I beat him. I remember when people said Barack Obama couldnít get elected. Shoot, I remember when people said Donald Trump couldnít get elected, but hereís where we are. I get it. There is a lot at stake and people are scared, but we canít choose a candidate we donít believe in just because weíre too scared to do anything else. And we canít ask other people to vote for a candidate we donít believe in. Democrats win when we figure out what is right, and we get out there and fight for it. I am not afraid. And for Democrats to win, you canít be afraid either."
2019-07-30,Delaney,"So, I think Democrats win when we run on real solutions, not impossible promises, when we run on things that are workable, not fairytale economics. Look at this story of Detroit, this amazing city that weíre in. This city is turning around because the government and the private sector or working well together. That has to be our model going forward. We need to encourage collaboration between the government, the private sector and the nonprofit sector, and focus on those kitchen table, pocketbook issues that matter to hardworking Americans, building infrastructure, creating jobs, improving their pay."
2019-07-30,Delaney,Creating universal healthcare and lowering drug prices. We can do it.
2019-07-30,Warren,"I donít understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really canít do and shouldnít fight for. I donít get it. Our biggest problem in Washington is corruption. It is giant corporations that have taken our government and that are holding it by the throat, and we need to have the courage to fight back against that. And until weíre ready to do that, itís just more of the same. Well, Iím ready to get in this fight. Iím ready to win this fight."
2019-07-30,Delaney,"When we created Social Security, we didnít say pensions were illegal. We can have big ideas to transform the lives. I mean, I started two companies and took them public before I was 40. Iím as big of a dreamer and an entrepreneur as anyone, but I also believe we need to have solutions that are workable. Can you imagine if we tried to start social security now, but said private pensions are illegal? Thatís the equivalent of what Senator Sanders and Senator Warren are proposing with healthcare. Thatís not a big idea. Thatís an idea thatís dead on arrival. That will never happen. So, why donít we actually talk about things, big ideas that we can get done. The stakes are too high."
2019-07-30,Delaney,"So, look, he talks-"
2019-07-30,Sanders,He just mentioned plans-
2019-07-30,Warren,"He talks about solutions that are workable. We have tried the solution of Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance, and what have the private insurance companies done? Theyíve sucked billions of dollars out of our healthcare system. Theyíve made everybody fill out dozens and dozens of forms. Why? Not because theyíre trying to track your healthcare. They just want one more excuse to say no. Insurance companies do not have a god given right to suck money out of our health care system, and 2020 is our chance to stop that."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Detroit was mentioned, and Iím delighted Detroit is rebounding. Let us understand. Detroit was nearly destroyed because of awful trade policy which allowed corporations to throw workers in this community out on the street as they moved to low wage countries. To win this election and to defeat Donald Trump, which by the way, in my view, is not going to be easy, we need to have a campaign of energy and excitement and of vision. We need to bring millions of young people into the political process in a way that we have never seen."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"By, among other things, making public colleges and universities tuition free and canceling student debt."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"Everyone wants to get elected, but my point is this. I think when we have a guy in the White House that has now told over 10000 lies, that we better be very straight forward with the American people. And no, do I think that we are going to end up voting for a plan that kicks half of America off of their current insurance in four years? No, I donít think weíre going to do that. I think there is a better way to get what we all want to see, which is lower costs for healthcare."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"Do I think that weíre going to vote to give free college to the wealthiest kids? No, I donít think weíre going to do that. So thatís what Iím talking about. But what I donít like about this argument right now, what I donít like about it at all, is that we are more worried about winning an argument than winning an election, and I think how we win in an election is to bring everyone with us. And yes, I have one in a state, every single time statewide, I have won those congressional districts that Donald Trump won by over 20 points. He just targeted Minnesota last week, and Iíve done it by getting out there and talking to people, by knowing rural issues and farm issues."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,And bringing metro people with me in the state that had the highest voter turnout in the country. Thatís what we want.
2019-07-30,Delaney,"Well first of all, because it ties its progress to other things that are completely unrelated to climate. Like universal healthcare, guaranteed government jobs and universal basic income. So that only makes it harder to do."
2019-07-30,Delaney,"My plan, which gets us to net zero by 2050, which we absolutely have to do for our kids and our grandkids, will get us there. I put a price on carbon, take all the money, give it back to the American people in a dividend. That was introduced by me on a bipartisan basis. Itís the only significant bipartisan climate bill in the Congress. Iím going to increase the Department of Energy research budget by five-fold because we fundamentally have to innovate our way out of this problem. Iím going to create a market for something called direct air capture, which are machines that actually take carbon out of the atmosphere because I donít think weíll get to net zero by 2050 unless we have those things. Iím going to increase investment in renewables, and Iím going to create something called the Climate Corp. That is a plan thatís realistic. Itís a bet on the US private innovation economy and creates the incentives to get us to-"
2019-07-30,Delaney,Ö net zero by 2050 for our kids.
2019-07-30,Warren,"So climate crisis is the existential crisis for our world. It puts every living thing on this planet at risk. I have a plan for a green industrial policy that takes advantage of the fact that we do what we do best, and that is innovate and create. So Iíve proposed putting $2 trillion in so we do the research. We then say anyone in the world can use it so long as you build it right here in America. That will produce about 1.2 million manufacturing jobs right here in Michigan, right here in Ohio, right here in the industrial Midwest."
2019-07-30,Warren,"And the second thing we will do is we will then sell those products all around the world. Right now, for every $1, the United States-"
2019-07-30,Warren,Ö spends trying to market around the world-
2019-07-30,Warren,Ö Chinaís spending $100.
2019-07-30,Warren,"Look, I put a real policy on the table. To create 1.2 million new jobs in green manufacturing. Thereís going to be up $23 trillion worldwide market for this. This could revitalize huge cities across this country, and no one wants to talk about. What you want to do instead is find the Republican talking point of a made-up piece of some other part and say, ìOh, we donít really have to do anything.î Thatís the problem weíve got in Washington right now. It continues-"
2019-07-30,Warren,"Ö to be a Washington that works great for oil companies, just not for people worried about climate change."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"I get a little bit tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas. Republicans are not afraid of big ideas. They could give $1 trillion in tax breaks to billionaires and profitable corporations. They could bail out the crooks on Wall Street. So please donít tell me that we cannot take on the fossil fuel industry, and nothing happens unless we do that."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Here is the bottom line. We got to ask ourselves a simple question. What do you do with an industry that knowingly, for billions of dollars in short-term profits, is destroying this planet? I say that itís criminal activity-"
2019-07-30,Sanders,Ö that cannot be allowed to continue.
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Look, on this issue, my friends, there is no choice. We have got to be super aggressive, if we love our children and if we want to leave them a planet that is healthy and is habitable. So I donít disagree with Tim. What that means is we got to A, take on the fossil fuel industry. B, it means we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy and a hell of a lot of good union jobs as we do that. Weíve got to transform our transportation system-"
2019-07-30,Sanders,And we have to lead the world-
2019-07-30,Sanders,Ö because this is not just an American issue.
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Look, Steve, ainít nobody in the Congress whoís more strongly pro worker than I am. So when I talk about taking on the fossil fuel industry, what I am also talking about is a just transition. All right? We can create, and what the Green New Deal is about, itís a bold idea. We can create millions of good paying jobs. We can rebuild communities in rural America that have been devastated. So we are not anti-worker. We are going to provide, make sure that those workers have a transition. New jobs, healthcare and education."
2019-07-30,Sanders,Yes.
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"We have all put out highly similar visions on climate. It is all theoretical. We will deal with climate if and only if we win the presidency, if and only if we beat Donald Trump. Nominate me and you get to see the President of the United States stand next to an American war veteran and explain why he chose to pretend to be disabled when it was his chance to serve. Nominate me and we will have a different conversation with American voters about why the President of the United States thinks youíre a sucker. When the problem in your life is your paycheck is not going up nearly as fast as the cost of housing or the cost of education-"
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,Ö or the cost of prescription drugs. And he has done nothing about it except a tax cut for the corporations.
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"Thank you, Dana. And I was just in Flint, and they are still drinking bottled water in that town, and that is outrageous. So my plan, and I am the first one that came out with an infrastructure plan, and I did that because this is a bread and butter issue. Itís a bread and butter issue for people that are caught in traffic jams. I think the governor here in Michigan smartly ran on the slogan, ìFix the damn roads.î And it is an issue for union jobs."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"And so I think what we need to do is not have a president thatís promised he was going to do that on election night, if anyone remembers, and then he hasnít followed through. He has done nothing. He blew up a meeting at the White House."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"I would put $1 trillion into this, and I would pay for it by, first of all, changing the capital gains rate, by doing something when it comes to that regressive tax bill that left everyone behind but really made his Mar-a-Lago friends richer, as he promised. And I would take that money and put it into rural broadband and green infrastructure so you wonít have what you just saw in Detroit with the Jefferson Chalmers neighborhood, the African neighborhood that was African-American neighborhood that was most hit when you had those recent rainstorms."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,And I truly believe that if weíre going to move on infrastructure-
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"Ö and climate change, you need a-"
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,Ö voice from the heartland.
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,That you need a voice from the heartland.
2019-07-30,Williamson,"My response on the Flint water crisis is that Flint is just the tip of the iceberg. I was recently in Denmark, South Carolina where it isÖ There is a lot of talk about it being the next Flint. We have an administration that has gutted the Clean Water Act. We have communities, particularly communities of color and disadvantaged communities, all over this country who are suffering from environmental injustice. I assure you, I lived in Grosse Pointe. What happened in Flint would not have happened in Grosse Pointe. This is part of the dark underbelly of American society. The racism, the bigotry, and the entire conversation that weíre having here tonight. If you think any of this wonkiness is is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country, then Iím afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days. We need to say it like it is. Itís bigger than Flint. Itís all over this country. Itís particularly people of color. Itís particularly people who do not have the money to fight back. And if the Democrats donít start saying it then why would those people feel that theyíre there for us? And if those people donít feel it they wonít vote for us and Donald Trump will win."
2019-07-30,Williamson,Thank you.
2019-07-30,Warren,Wait.
2019-07-30,Warren,"We need to call out white supremacy for what it is, domestic terrorism. And it poses a threat to the United States of America. We live in a country now where the president is advancing environmental racism, economic racism, criminal justice racism, health care racism. The way we do better is to fight back and show something better. So I have a plan, for example, on education that says we have to build a better education system for all our kids. But weíve got to acknowledge whatís happened on race. So my plan has universal tuition-free college for all of our kids, but also increases the Pell grants and levels the playing field by putting $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities. It cancels student loan debt for 95% of the kids with student loan debt and helps close the black-white wealth gap in America."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"As an urban mayor serving a diverse community, the racial divide lives within me. Iím not saying that I became mayor and racism or crime or poverty ended on my watch. But in our city we have come together repeatedly to tackle challenges like the fact that far too many people were not getting the help they needed in their housing, and so we directed it to a historically under-invested African-American neighborhood. Right now, in the wake of a police-involved shooting, our community is moving from hurting to healing by making sure that the community can participate in things like revising the use-of-force policy and making sure there are community voices on the board of safety that handles police matters. I proposed a Douglass plan to tackle this issue nationally, because mayors have hit the limits of what you can do unless there is national action. Systemic racism has touched every part of American life, from housing to health to home ownership. If you walk into an emergency room and you are black, your reports of pain will be taken less seriously. If you apply for a job and you are black, you are less likely to be called just because of the name on the resume. Itís why Iíve proposed that we do everything from investing in historically-redlined neighborhoods-"
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,Ö To build black wealth in home ownership.
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,To supporting entrepreneurship for black Americans.
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"Well, first of all, there are people that voted for Donald Trump before that arenít racist, they just wanted a better shake in the economy. And so I would appeal to them. But I donít think anyone can justify what this president is doing. Little kids literally woke up this weekend, turned on the TV, and saw their president calling their city, the town of Baltimore, nothing more than a home for rats. And I can tell you, as your president, that will stop. The second thing I would say is that economic opportunity means economic opportunity for everyone in this country. I know that because I have lived it. And that means when we put out there better childcare and better education and we pay teachers more and we make sure thereís a decent retirement system in place. Yes, we help the African-American community, and we must, because they have been the ones that have been most hurt by what weíve seen in the last decades. But we help everyone. So what I say to the people in my rural parts of my state, just like I say to them in the city and bring them together, is that economic opportunity must be there for everyone."
2019-07-30,Williamson,"Senator Klobuchar, thank you very much. Congressman OíRourke, please respond."
2019-07-30,Williamson,"Well, first of all, itís not 500 billion dollars in financial assistance. Itís 500 billion dollar, 200 to 500 billion dollars, payment of a debt that is owed. That is what reparations is. We need some deep truth-telling when it comes. We donít need another commission to look at evidence. I appreciate what Congressman OíRourke has said. It is time for us to simply realize that this country will not heal. All that a country is as a collection of people. People heal when there is some deep truth-telling. We need to recognize that, when it comes to the economic gap between blacks and whites in America, it does come from a great injustice that has never been dealt with. That great injustice has had to do with the fact that there was 250 years of slavery followed by another 100 years of domestic terrorism."
2019-07-30,Williamson,"What makes me qualified to say 200 to 500 billion dollars? Iíll tell you what makes me qualified. If you did the math of the 40 acres and a mule, given that there was four to five million slaves at the end of the civil war, four to five, and they were all promised 40 acres and a mule for every family of four. If you did the math today, it would be trillions of dollars. And I believe that anything less than a hundred billion dollars is an insult. And I believe that 200 to 500 billion is politically feasible today, because so many Americans realize there is an injustice that continues to form a toxicity underneath the surface and emotional turbulence that only reparations will heal."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Well, I respond to that by saying that I am supportive of Jim Clyburnís legislation, which is called 10-20-30. And what that understands is that, as a result of slavery and segregation and the institutional racism we see now in healthcare, in education, in financial services, we are going to have to focus big time on rebuilding distressed communities in America, including African-American communities. In terms of education, I also have a plan. Itís called the Thurgood Marshall Plan, and it would focus on ending the growth of segregated schools in America. It would triple funding for Title I schools. It would make sure that teachers in this country earned at least $60,000 a year."
2019-07-30,Delaney,"So listen, this is what I donít understand. President Trump wants to build physical walls and beats up on immigrants. Most of the folks running for president want to build economic walls to free trade and beat up on President Obama."
2019-07-30,Delaney,"Iím the only one running for president who actually supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership. President Obama was right about that. We should be getting back in that. Senator Warren just issued a trade plan [crosstalk 00:02:32] that would prevent the United States from trading with its allies. We canít go and we canít isolate ourselves from the world. We have to engage with fair, rules-based trade."
2019-07-30,Warren,"For decades we have had a trade policy that has been written by giant, multinational corporations to help giant, multinational corporations. They have no loyalty to America. They have no patriotism. If they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico, theyíll do it in a heartbeat. If they can continue a polluting plant by moving it to Vietnam, theyíll do it in a heartbeat."
2019-07-30,Warren,"I have put out a new comprehensive plan that says weíre not going to do it that way. Weíre going to negotiate our deals with unions at the table, with small businesses at the table, with small farmers at the table, with environmentalists at the table, with human rights activists at the table. And then weíre going to use the fact that everybody in the world wants to get to Americaís markets. They want to sell to you."
2019-07-30,Delaney,That was the TPP.
2019-07-30,Warren,Iíll finish.
2019-07-30,Delaney,Sorry.
2019-07-30,Warren,Is everyone wants to get to American markets.
2019-07-30,Warren,No. So the question is-
2019-07-30,Warren,We need to raise our standards.
2019-07-30,Delaney,"So, that was the Trans-Pacific partnership. I think President Obama was right. He did include environmental standards. He did include labor standards. We would be in an entirely different position with China if we had entered the Trans-Pacific partnership."
2019-07-30,Delaney,"We canít isolate ourselves from the world. We canít isolate ourselves from Asia. Senator Warrenís plan basically, that she put out, we would not be able to trade with the United Kingdom."
2019-07-30,Warren,"No, what this is about-"
2019-07-30,Delaney,We would not be able to trade with the EU. It is so extreme that itíll isolate-
2019-07-30,Delaney,Ö the American-
2019-07-30,Delaney,Ö economy from the rest of the world.
2019-07-30,Sanders,[inaudible 00:04:21].
2019-07-30,Sanders,[crosstalk 00:04:22].
2019-07-30,Warren,[crosstalk 00:04:23]. I think he said Warren.
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Oh, Iím sorry."
2019-07-30,Warren,"What the congressman is describing as extreme is having deals that are negotiated by American workers for American workers. American workers want those jobs, and we can build the trade deals that do it. People want access to our markets all around the world. Then the answer is letís make them raise their standards, make them pay their workers more, let their workers unionize, raise their environmental standards before they come to us and say they want to be able to sell their products."
2019-07-30,Warren,"Right now, the whole game is working for the big multinationals. Itís just not working for the people here in the United States, and we can change that."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Yeah, okay. Youíre looking, I believe, at that the only member of Congress who not only voted against these disastrous trade agreements, NAFTA, PNTR with China, which costs us over four million jobs, but also helped lead the effort against these agreements."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Now, Elizabeth is absolutely right. If anybody here thinks that corporate America gives one damn about the average American worker, youíre mistaken. If they can save five cents by going to China, Mexico, or Vietnam, or any place else, thatís exactly what they will do."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"As president, let me tell you what I will do. These guys line up at the federal troughs. They want military contracts, they want all kinds of contracts. Well, under my administration, you ainít going to get those contracts if you throw American workers out on the street."
2019-07-30,Warren,"Anyone who thinks that these trade deals are mostly about tariffs just donít understand whatís going on. Look at the new NAFTA 2.0. Whatís the central feature? Itís to help pharmaceutical companies get longer periods of exclusivity so they can charge Canadians, Americans, and Mexicans more money and make more profits. Thatís what trade deals haveÖ"
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,Ö rid of loans.
2019-07-30,Sanders,"As a matter of fact, I do, but before I get into that, the major issue that we donít talk about in Congress, you donít talk about in the media, is the massive level of income and wealth inequality in America. You got three people who own more wealth than the bottom 90%. You got 1% that owns more wealth than the bottom 92%. 49% of all new income goes to the top 1%."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Companies like Amazon and billionaires out there do not pay one nickel in federal income tax, and weíve got 500,000 people sleeping out on the street. What we need is a political revolution that tells these billionaires and corporate America that they are Americans, theyíll participate in our society, but they have got to start paying their fair share of taxes, period."
2019-07-30,Warren,Iíd like to respond.
2019-07-30,Williamson,I think that all domestic and international policies should be based on the idea that anything we do to help people thrive is a stimulation to our economy. Thatís how you stimulate your economy. So if a few people take advantage but there are four or five people who are going to take the money that they then have in the bankÖ
2019-07-30,Williamson,"When you look at this $1.5 trillion college debt, this is why I agree with Bernie or I would be the, okay, why donít we swap it? We had a $2 trillion tax cut where 83 cents of every dollar goes to the very, very richest among us. That does not stimulate the economy."
2019-07-30,Williamson,"If we get rid of this college debt, think of all the young people who will have the discretionary spending, theyíll be able to start their business. The best thing you could do to stimulate the US economy is to get rid of this debt. This is not just about a plan to do it; itís about a philosophy of governing."
2019-07-30,Williamson,"And Iíve heard some people hear tonight, I almost wonder why youíre Democrats. You seem to think thereís something wrong about using the instruments of government to help people. That is what government should do. All policy should help people thrive. That is how we will have peace and that is how we will help [crosstalk 00:10:19]."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"I want to make it easier for kids to go to college, and I think we do it by focusing our resources on the people that need it most. And my problem with some of these plans is they literally would pay for wealthy kids, for Wall Street kids, to go to college. Thereís no difference. It says everyone is free. I donít think that makes sense, and I am very concerned if we do things like that, the debt weíre going to pass on to the next generation and the next generation."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"So what I would do about student loan debt is that I would allow people to refinance it at a better rate, and I would make sure that we improve those student loan repayment programs for our teachers, and expand them so that you literally over five, 10 years can get it paid for if you go into occupations where we donít have enough workers. I think we need to mesh what we were just talking about with the economy-"
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,Ö with our education policy.
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Trump is a pathological liar. I tell the truth. We have been in Afghanistan I think 18 years, in Iraq 16 or 17 years. We have spent $5 trillion on the war on terror, and there are probably more terrorists out there now than before it began."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Weíre going to spendÖ The Congress passed, and I will not vote for, a $715 billion military budget more than the 10 next countries combined. What we need is a foreign policy that focuses on diplomacy, ending conflicts by people sitting at a table, not by killing each other. As president of the United States, I will go to the United Nations and not denigrate it, not attack the UN, but bring countries together in the Middle East and all over the world to come to terms with their differences and solve those problems peacefully. The United States-"
2019-07-30,Sanders,Ö cannot be the policeman of the world.
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,I think we agree. I just think you have to leave open the possibility of meeting with anyone at any place.
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"What I donít like is how this president has handled it. Youíve heard of the Truman doctrine, the Monroe doctrine. Heís done the go it alone doctrine with the rest of the world. Heís taken us out of the climate change agreement, out of the Iran nuclear agreement, out of the Russian nuclear agreement, and I donít agree with that."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"And when he was just with Vladimir Putin at the G20, when he was asked about invading our democracy, he made a joke. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost their lives on the battlefield to protect our democracy and our right to vote."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"Four little girls in Birmingham, Alabama lost their life in a church at the heights-"
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"Ö of the civil rights amendment. So I do believe you meet with people, but you better have an agenda."

2019-07-30,Buttigieg,We will withdraw. We have to.
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"Yes. Look, around the world we will do whatever it takes to keep America safe, but I thought I was one of the last troops leaving Afghanistan when I thought I was turning out the lights years ago."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"Every time I see news about somebody being killed in Afghanistan, I think about what it was like to hear an explosion over there and wonder whether it was somebody that I served with, somebody that I knew, a friend, roommate, colleague."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"Weíre pretty close to the day when we will wake up to the news of a casualty in Afghanistan who was not born on 9/11. I was sent into that war by a congressional authorization as well as the president, and we need to talk not only about the need for a president committed to ending endless war, but the fact that Congress has been asleep at the switch."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"And on my watch, I will propose that any authorization for the use of military force have a three-year sunset and have to be renewed because if men and women in the military have the courage to go serve, members of Congress ought to have to summon-"
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,Ö the courage to vote on whether they ought to [crosstalk 00:18:10].
2019-07-30,Williamson,Thank you.
2019-07-30,Warren,"Because it makes the world safer. The United States is not going to use nuclear weapons preemptively, and we need to say so to the entire world. It reduces the likelihood that someone miscalculate, someone misunderstands."
2019-07-30,Warren,"Our first responsibility is to keep ourselves safe, and whatís happening right now with Donald Trump as they keep expanding the different ways that we have nuclear weapons, the different ways that they can be used, puts us all at risk."
2019-07-30,Warren,"You know, we talk about whatís happening around the world. I have three older brothers who served in the military. I see that they would do anything. Our military is the best on earth, but we should not be asking our military to take on jobs that do not have a military solution. We need to use our diplomatic tools, our economic tools, and if weíre going to send someone into war, we better have a plan for how weíre going to get them out on the other end."
2019-07-30,Warren,"We donít expand trust around the world by saying, ìNo, we might be the first ones to use a nuclear weapon.î That puts the entire world at risk and puts us at risk right in the middle of this. At a time when Donald Trump is pulling out of our nuclear negotiations, expanding the opportunities for nuclear proliferation around the world, has pulled us out of the deal in Iran, and Iran is now working on its nuclear weapon, the world gets closer and closer to nuclear warfare."
2019-07-30,Warren,We have to have an-
2019-07-30,Warren,Ö announced policy that is one the entire world can live with. We need to make that clear. We will respond-

2019-07-30,Warren,What?
2019-07-30,Sanders,Could I add something to that discussion?
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,I donít care how old you are. I care about your vision. But I do think it matters that we have a new generation of leaders stepping up around the world. Leaders like theÖ I actually think itís good that the prime minister of New Zealand has gotten a lot of attention in Democratic debates. Sheís masterful. She is younger than I would be when I take office.
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"This is the kind of trend America might be leading instead of following, but only if itís actually backed by the right vision. And we can have great presidents at any age. What I will say is we need the kind of vision thatís going to win. We cannot have a vision that amounts to back to normal. Because the only reason we got this president is that normal didnít work. We have to be ready to take on this president."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"And by the way, something that hasnít been talked about as much tonight, take on his enablers in Congress. You know, when David DukeÖ When David Duke ran for Congress, ran for governor, the Republican Party 20 years ago ran away from him. Today, they are supporting naked racism in the White House who were at best silent about it."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"And if you were watching this at home and you are a Republican member of Congress, consider the fact that when the sun sets on your career and they are writing your story of all the good and bad things you did in your life, the thing you will be remembered for is whether in this moment with this president, you found the courage to stand up to him or you continue to put party over country."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Well, Pete is right. Itís a question of vision, thatís what it is. Whether youíre young, whether youíre old, whether youíre in between. And my vision among other things says that if weíre going to fight for healthcare, we donít take money from the drug companies or the insurance companies. And I have asked all of the candidates who are running to say they will not accept money from those entities who in my view are going to war against the American people in terms of healthcare. Thatís a new vision."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"A new vision says that we must cancel completely student debt because the younger generation in this country today, for the first time in modern American history, will have a lower standard of living than their parents."
2019-07-30,Williamson,"Yes. Our problem is not just that we need to defeat Donald Trump. We need a plan to solve institutionalized hatred, collectivized hatred and White nationalism. In order to do that, we need more than political insight, or game, and wonkiness, and intellectual argument. Those things will not defeat Donald Trump."
2019-07-30,Williamson,"We need some radical truth telling, not just to talk about healthcare but talk about why weíre so sick all the time. We need to have a serious conversation about race and what is truly owed. Even on the subject of foreign policy, itís all about symptoms and not about cars. We need to talk about the fact that the United States has sacrificed our moral leadership, the fact that countries see us not only domestically but internationally with policies that simply support our corporate overlords."
2019-07-30,Williamson,"The fact that our national defense agenda is driven more by short-term profits for defense contractors than by genuine peace building. Thereís some corruption thatís so deep, ladies and gentleman. Until the Democratic Party is ready to speak to deeper corruption knowing that we ourselves sometimes because of our own corporate donations have participated, then Iím afraid those who vote for Trump will continue to vote for Trump and those who might not like Donald Trump will continue to stay home."
2019-07-30,Williamson,"I want a politics that goes much deeper. I want a politics that speaks to the heart, because the only way to fight Ö you keep talking about how weíre going to fight Donald Trump. You canít fight dog whistles, you have to override them. The only way you can override them is with new voices, voices of energy that only come from the fact that America has been willing to live up to our own mistakes, atone for our own mistakes, make amends for our own mistakes, love each other, love our democracy, love future generations, something emotional and psychological that will not be emerging from anything on this stage. It will emerge from something Iím the one whoís qualified to bring forth."
2019-07-30,Delaney,"Thank you Jake. John F. Kennedy famously said, ìWe should not seek the Republican answer. We should not seek the Democratic answer. We should seek the right answer.î He was right when he said, and heís right today as well."
2019-07-30,Delaney,"Donald Trump is the symptom of a disease, and the disease is divisiveness. Iím the only one on this stage talking about curing that disease with big ideas like national service by focusing on actually solving problems. If we work together, we can fix healthcare and build infrastructure. We can invest in not just technology but people and entrepreneurs, whether they be in Storm Lake, Iowa or Detroit, Michigan or Baltimore, Maryland."
2019-07-30,Delaney,"We can fight climate change and reimagine our education system, but we have to do it with real solutions not impossible promises. Isnít it time we had a president who was a leader in both the private sector and in government to lead us into the future? I promise as president I will restore vision, unity, and leadership and decency to this country. Thatís why Iím running for president. Thank you."
2019-07-30,Hickenlooper,Thank you. What a night. Iíve loved it. Iíd like to ask every American to imagine that you are facing life threatening surgery tomorrow. Would you choose a doctor who had a track record of proven success whoíd actually done the work or someone who had just talked about it? Thatís the question weíre facing in this primary.
2019-07-30,Hickenlooper,"Iíve actually got a track record as a small business owner, as a mayor and as a governor. We expanded healthcare in Colorado and got near universal coverage. We fought climate change directly. We beat the NRA. For the last three years, weíve been the number one economy in the country. We can ramp all that out."
2019-07-30,Hickenlooper,"Iím as progressive as anybody up on this stage, but Iím also pragmatic. Iíve done the things that most of these other people are just talking about, and I know I can get results. I can lead the people of this country toward a stronger, a healthier and a more secure future and defeat Donald Trump and return this country to its glory. Thank you."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"Well, thank you Detroit. To win we have to listen to people. Out there today is Casey Joeís mom. Casey Joe was a champion high school swimmer from a small town. She got sick, went to the emergency room and got hooked on opioids. The last thing that she said to her mom was, ìMomma, itís not my fault,î and she died."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"A lot of Americans say the same thing every day, and that is what I will stand up for. What I will stand up against are companies like those pharma companies that got her hooked on those opioids and didnít tell the doctors or the patients what was going to happen."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"We need someone that has peopleís back. We also need someone that can win, and I have won in these red districts. I win in the Midwest. I can win in states like Wisconsin, and Michigan and Iowa. I also will do my job without fear or favor just like I did as a prosecutor and get through the gridlock like Iíve done as a senator where Iíve passed over a hundred bills where Iíve been the lead Democrat."
2019-07-30,Klobuchar,"Last, yes, I will govern with integrity. We have the President where people turn off their TV when they see him. Not me. I will make you proud as your president."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"Thereís good news and bad news. Iím going to start with the bad news. Our countryís in trouble. GPD is going up, and life expectancy is going down. Think about what that means. Itís only getting tougher. By 2030, we will have passed the point of no return on climate. There could be 130 million more guns on our streets. Iíll be in my 40s then. If you have kids, think about how old they will be then."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"Hereís the good news. Itís not too late. We can tell our kids that before we ran out of time, just before we ran out of time in 2020, we did what it took to deliver a climate that we didnít have to wonder if it could support us, to deliver a society where race has no bearing on your health or your wealth or your relationship with law enforcement, that we did what it took to deliver an economy where a rising tide actually does lift all boats."
2019-07-30,Buttigieg,"We can do this if and only if we are ready to walk away from what hasnít worked with bold action and win, not only defeat this President but defeat his congressional allies with a defeat so big that it reunites the Republican Party with its conscience as well as bringing Democrats to office. Join me and letís make it happen."
2019-07-30,Warren,"From the time I was seven years old, I had a dream. I wanted to be a public school teacher, but my daddy ended up as a janitor. By the time I graduated from high school, my family didnít have the money to send me off to college. My big chance was what was then a commuter college that cost $50 a semester."
2019-07-30,Warren,"For me, what this election is all about is opportunity. Every budget, every policy that we talk about is about whoís going to get opportunity. Is it going to go to the billionaires, or is it going to go to our kids? Right now for decades, we have had a government that has been on the side of the rich and the powerful. It has been on the side of the wealthy. That means it has not been on the side of everyone else. Not on the side of people living on our Native American reservations, people living in inner cities, people living on small farms and small communities across this country."
2019-07-30,Warren,"How do we beat it? We beat it by being the party of big structural change. Give people a reason to show up and vote. We beat it by building a grassroots movement across this country, not showing up behind closed doors with millionaires but actually building it person-by-person across this country with small dollar donations, with volunteers, with people who show up and say, ìI have a stake in this democracy.î"
2019-07-30,Warren,"I will not only beat Donald Trump in 2020, Iíll start to make real change come 2021."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"As somebody who grew up in a family that lived in a rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York and lived paycheck to paycheck, Iím running for president not just to defeat the most dangerous president in this history of this country, a guy whoís a racist, and a sexist and a homophobe. Iím running to transform this country and to stand with the working class of America, which for the last 45 years has been decimated."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Two days ago, I had a remarkable experience, which should tell you everything you need to know about whatís going on in America. I took 15 people with diabetes from Detroit a few miles into Canada, and we bought insulin for one-tenth the price being charged by the crooks who run the pharmaceutical industry in America today."
2019-07-30,Sanders,"Itís not just the price fixing and the corruption and the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, itís whatís going on in the fossil fuel industry. Itís whatís going on in Wall Street. Itís whatís going on with the prison industrial complex. We need a mass political movement."
2019-07-30,Sanders,Please go to BernieSanders.com. Become one of our million volunteers. Stand up and take on the greed and corruption of the ruling class of this country. Letís create a government and an economy that works for all of us not just the one percent.
2019-06-27,Sanders,"Okay. Well, youíre quite right. We have a new vision for America. And at a time when we have three people in this country owning more wealth than the bottom half of America, while 500,000 people are sleeping out on the streets today, we think it is time for change, real change. And by that I mean that healthcare, in my view, is a human right and we have got to pass a Medicare for All, single payer system."
2019-06-27,Sanders,"Under that system, by the way, vast majority of the people in this country will be paying significantly less for healthcare than they are right now."
2019-06-27,Sanders,"I believe that education is the future for this country, and that is why I believe that we must make public colleges and universities tuition free and eliminate student debt, and we do that by placing a tax on Wall Street."
2019-06-27,Sanders,Every proposal that I have brought forth is fully paid for.
2019-06-27,Sanders,"People who have healthcare on the Medicare for All will have no premiums, no deductibles, no co-payments, no out-of-pocket expenses. Yes, they will pay more taxes but less in healthcare for what they get."
2019-06-27,Bennet,"Senator Sanders, [crosstalk 00:01:56]."
2019-06-27,Biden,"What I meant by that is, look, Donald Trump thinks Wall Street built America. Ordinary middle class Americans built American. My dad used to have an expression. He said, ìJoe, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. Itís about your dignity. Itís about respect. Itís being able to look your kid in the eye and say everythingís going to be okay.î"
2019-06-27,Biden,"Too many people who are in the middle class and poor, have had the bottom fall out under this proposal. What Iím saying is that weíve got to be straight forward. We have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class, they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it. They have to make sure that we are in a situation where thereís continuing education and theyíre able to pay for it, and they have to make sure that theyíre able to breathe air that is clean and they have water that they can drink."
2019-06-27,Biden,"Look, Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation, we do have enormous income inequality. The one thing I agree on is we can make massive cuts in the $1.6 trillion in tax loopholes out there, and I would be going about eliminating Donald Trumpís tax cuts for the wealthy."
2019-06-27,Harris,"Well, let me tell you something. I hear that question, but where was that question when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax bill that benefits the top 1%, and the biggest corporations in this country, contributing at least $1 trillion to the debt of America, which middle class families will pay for one way or another."
2019-06-27,Harris,"Working families need support and need to be lifted up, and frankly, this economy is not working for working people. For too long, the rules have been written in the favor of the people who have the most, and not in favor of the people who work the most, which is why I am proposing that we change the tax code."
2019-06-27,Harris,"So for every family that is making less than $100,000 a year, they will receive a tax credit that they can collect $500 a month, which will make all the difference between those families being able to get through the end of the month with dignity and with support, or not. And on day one, I will repeal that tax bill that benefits the top 1%, and the biggest corporations of America."
2019-06-27,Sanders,"Well, I think the responses at the polls, the last poll I saw has us 10 points ahead of Donald Trump because the American people understand that Trump is a phony, that Trump is a pathological liar and a racist, and that he lied to the American people during his campaign."
2019-06-27,Sanders,"He said he was going to stand up for working families, well President Trump, youíre not standing up for working families when you try to throw 32 million people off their healthcare that they have, and that 83% of your tax benefits go to the top 1%. Thatís how we beat Trump. We expose him for the fraud that he is."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,In answer-
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,I want to talk about-
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"I disagree with both their perspectives. The debate weíre having in our party right now is confusing, because the truth is thereís a big difference between capitalism on the one hand, and greed on the other. And so all the things that weíre trying to change is when companies care more about profits when they do about people."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"If youíre talking about ending gun violence, itís the greed of the NRA and the gun manufacturers that make any progress possible. Itís the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies, when we want to try to get healthcare as a right and not a privilege."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"So there need not be disagreement in the party, because in truth, we want healthy capitalism."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,We donít want corrupted capitalism-
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,Ö which is the definition of greed.
2019-06-27,Bennet,Was that directed to me?
2019-06-27,Bennet,"Oh, thank you. That sounded like me. Thank you."
2019-06-27,Bennet,I appreciate it.
2019-06-27,Bennet,"Well look, first of all, I agree completely with Bernie about what the fundamental challenge weíre facing as a country is. 40 years of no economic growth for 90% of the American people, 160,000 families in the top 0.1% have the same wealth as the bottom 90%, and weíve got the worst income inequality that weíve had in 100 years."
2019-06-27,Bennet,"Where I disagree is on his solution on Medicare for All. You know, I have proposed getting to universal healthcare, which we need to do, it is a right. Healthcare is a right. We need to get to universal healthcare. I believe the way to do that is by finishing the work we started with Obamacare and creating a public option, that every family and every person in America can make a choice for their family about whether they want a public option, which for them would be like having Medicare for All, or whether they want to keep their private insurance."
2019-06-27,Bennet,I believe we will get there much more quickly if we do that.
2019-06-27,Bennet,[crosstalk 00:09:19].
2019-06-27,Bennet,"Bernie Ö If I could just finish. Bernie mentioned that the taxes that we would have to pay, because of those taxes, Vermont rejected Medicare for All, and we shouldnít be [crosstalk 00:09:28]."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,In Bernieís bill-
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"In Bernieís bill, I wrote-"
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"I wrote the part in Senator Sandersí bill. I wrote the part in Senator Sandersí bill, that is the transition which merges what the two Senators said."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,Because the truth is if you have a buy in over a four or five year period-
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,Ö you move us to single payer more quickly.
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,Beunas noches. [foreign language 00:10:03].
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,Sure. College affordability is personal for us. Chasten and I have six figure student debt.
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"I believe in reducing student debt. Itís logical to me that if you can refinance your house, you ought to be able to refinance your student debt. I also believe in free college for low and middle income students for whom cost could be a barrier."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"I just donít believe it makes sense to ask working class families to subsidize, even the children of billionaires. I think the children of the wealthiest Americans can pay at least a little bit of tuition, and while I want tuition cost to go down, I donít think we can buy down every last penny for them."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"Now, thereís something else that doesnít get talked about in the college affordability debate. Yes, it needs to be more affordable in this country to go to college. It also needs to be more affordable in this country to not go to college. You should be able to live well, afford rent, be generous to your church and little league, whether you went to college or not. Thatís one of many reasons we need to raise the minimum wage to at least $15 an hour."
2019-06-27,Yang,Thatís right.
2019-06-27,Yang,Iím sorry?
2019-06-27,Yang,"Oh, so itís difficult to do if you have companies like Amazon, trillion dollar tech companies paying literally zero in taxes, while theyíre closing 30% of our stores."
2019-06-27,Yang,"Now, we need to put the American people in a position to benefit from all these innovations in other parts of the economy, and if we had a value added tax at even half the European level, it would generate over $800 billion in new revenue, which combined with the money in our hands, it would be the trickle up economy from our people, families and communities up. We would spend the money and it would circulate through our regional economies and neighborhoods, creating millions of jobs, making our families stronger and healthier."
2019-06-27,Yang,"Weíd save money on things like incarceration, homelessness services, emergency room healthcare. And just the value gains from having a stronger, healthier, mentally healthier population would increase GDP by $700 billion. This is the move that we have to make, particularly as technology is now automating away millions of American jobs. Itís why Donald Trump is our President today, that we automated away four million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And weíre about to do the same thing to millions of retail jobs, call center jobs, fast food jobs, truck driving jobs, and on and on through the account."
2019-06-27,Yang,"Well, the value added tax would end up Ö youíd still be increasing the buying power of the bottom 94% of Americans. You have to spend a lot of money for a mild value add tax to eat up $12,000 a year per individual. So for the average family with two or three adults, itíd be $24,000 to $36,000 a year."
2019-06-27,Biden,"I would. Iím still holding on that torch. I want to make it clear to you. Look, the fact of the matter is what we have to do is make sure that everybody is prepared better to go on for an education."
2019-06-27,Biden,"The fact is that, thatís why I propose us focusing on schools that are in distress. Thatís why I think we should triple the amount of money we spend for Title 1 schools. Thatís why I think we should have universal pre-k. Thatís why I think every single person who graduates from high school, 65 out of a 100 now need something beyond high school, and we should provide for them to be able to get that education. Thatís why there should be free community college, cutting it in half the cost of college. Thatís why we should be in a position where we do not have anyone have to pay back a student debt when they get out if they are making less than $25,000 a year. Their debt is frozen, no interest payment until they get beyond that."
2019-06-27,Biden,"We canít put people in a position where they arenít able to go on and move on. So folks, thereís a lot we can do, but we have to make continuing education available for everyone so that everyone can compete in the 21st century. Weíre not doing that now."
2019-06-27,Sanders,Itís part of Joeís generation.
2019-06-27,Sanders,Itís part of Joeís generation.
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,Before we move on.
2019-06-27,Sanders,Let me respond.
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,Before we move on from education-
2019-06-27,Sanders,"The issue, if I may say, is not generational."
2019-06-27,Sanders,The issue is not generational.
2019-06-27,Sanders,[crosstalk 00:16:21].
2019-06-27,Sanders,"The issue is who has the guts to take on Wall Street, to take on the fossil fuel industry, to take on the big money interests who have unbelievable influence over the economic and political life of this county."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,[inaudible 00:16:40].
2019-06-27,Harris,"Hey guys, you know what? America does not want to witness a food fight, they want to know how weíre going to put food on their table. On that point, part of the issue that is at play in America today, and weíve all been traveling around the country, I certainly have. Iím meeting people who are working two and three jobs. You know, this President walks around talking about and flouting his great economy, right? My great economy, my great economy. You ask him, ìWell, how are you measuring this greatness of this economy of yours?î And he talks about the stock market."
2019-06-27,Harris,"Well, thatís fine if you own stocks. So many families in America do not. You ask him, ìHow are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours?î And they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers. Well, yeah, people in America are working. Theyíre working two and three jobs. So when we talk about jobs, letís be really clear, in our America, no one should have to work more than one job to have a roof over their head and food on the table."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"Yeah, so no itís my turn."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"This is a very important issue. The plan that Senator Sanders and I other support Medicare for All, is how you get to single payer. But it has a buy-in transition period, which is really important. In 2005, when I ran for Congress in a two to one republican district, I actually ran on Medicare for All, and I won that two to one republican district. Twice."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"The way I formulated it was simple. Anyone who doesnít have access to insurance they like, they could buy in at a percentage of income they could afford. Thatís what we put into the transition period for our Medicare for All plan. I believe we need to get to universal healthcare as a right and not a privilege to single pair. The quickest way you get there is you create competition with the insurers."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"God bless the insurers if they want to compete. They can certainly try. But theyíve never put people over their profits, and I doubt they ever will. What will happen is people will choose Medicare, you will transition. We will get to Medicare for All, and then your step to single player is so short I would make it an earned benefit, just like Social Security, so that buy in your whole life-"
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"It is always there for you, and itís permanent and itís universal."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"Yo, weíve taughtÖ Look, everybody who says Medicare for All, every person in politics who allows that phrase to escape their lips has a responsibility to explain how youíre actually supposed to get from here to there."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"And hereís how I would do it. Itís very similar. I would call it Medicare for All Who Want It. You take something like Medicare, a flavor of that, and you make it available on the exchanges. People can buy in, and then people like us are right that that will not only a more inclusive plan, but a more efficient plan than any of the corporate answers out there, then it will be a very natural glide path to the single payer environment."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"But letís remember, even in countries that have outright socialized medicine like England, even there, thereís still a private sector. Thatís fine, itís just that for our primary care we canít be relying on the tender mercies of the corporate system. This is one is very personal for me. I started out this year dealing with the terminal illness of my father. I make decisions for a living."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"Nothing could have prepared me for the kind of decisions our family faced. But the thing we had going for us was that we never had to make those decisions based on whether it was going to bankrupt our family, because of Medicare."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"I want every family to have that same freedom to do what is medically right, not live in [crosstalk 00:20:49]."
2019-06-27,Biden,"Look, this is very personal to me. When my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, my two boys were really very badly injured. I couldnít imagine what itíd be like had I not had adequate healthcare available immediately. Then when my son came home from Iraq after a year and was diagnosed with terminal cancer, he was given months to live."
2019-06-27,Biden,"I canít fathom what would have happened if in fact they said, ìBy the way, the last six months of your life, youíre on your own. Weíre cutting off. Youíve used up your time.î The fact of the matter is, that the quickest, fastest way to do it is build on Obamacare. To build on what we did. Secondly, to make sure that everyone does have any option."
2019-06-27,Biden,"Everyone, whether they have private insurance, employer insurance, or no insurance, they in fact could buy in in the exchange to a Medicare-like plan. The way to do that, you can do it quickly. Look, urgency matters. Thereís people right now facing what I faced, and what we faced, without any of the help I had. We must move now. I am against any democrat who opposes and tries to take down Obamacare-"
2019-06-27,Biden,And any republican who wants to get rid of Obamacare [crosstalk 00:22:07].
2019-06-27,Sanders,"Listen, I find it hard to believe that other major country on earth, including my neighbor 50 miles north me- Canada, somehow has figured out a way to provide healthcare to every man, woman and child, and in most cases, theyíre spending 50% per capita what we are spending. Letís be clear. Let us be very clear."
2019-06-27,Sanders,"The function of healthcare today from the insurance and drug company perspective, is not to provide quality care to all in a cost effective way. The function of the healthcare system today is to make billions in profits for the insurance companies. Last year, if you could believe it, while we paid the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs- and I will lower the prescription drug prices in half in this country- Top 10 companies made $69 billion dollars in profit."
2019-06-27,Sanders,"They will spend hundreds of millions of dollars lying to the American people, telling us why we cannot have a Medicare for All [crosstalk 00:23:35]-"
2019-06-27,Sanders,Iím sorry?
2019-06-27,Sanders,"I will tell you how weíll do it. Weíll do it way real change has always taken place, whether it was the Labor Movement, the Civil Rights Movement, or the Womenís Movement. We will have Medicare for All. When tens of millions of people are prepared to stand up and tell the insurance companies and the drug companies that their day is gone, that healthcare is a human right, not something to make huge profits off of."
2019-06-27,Williamson,"Well, first of all, the government should never had made the deal with the big pharma that they couldnít negotiate. That was just part of the regular corruption by which multinational corporations have their way with us. You know, I wanted to say that while Iím with Senator Bennet and others, but I agree with almost everything here- Iíll tell you one thing, itís really nice that weíve got all these plans, but if you think weíre going to beat Donald Trump by just having all these plans, you got another thing coming. Because he didnít win by saying he had a plan. He won by simply saying, ìMake America Great Again.î"
2019-06-27,Williamson,"Weíve got to get deeper than just these superficial fixes, as important as they are. Even if weíre just talking about the superficial fixes, ladies and gentlemen, we donít have a healthcare system in the United States. We have a sickness care system in the United States. We just wait until somebody gets sick, and then we talk about whoís going to pay for the treatment and how theyíre going to be treated."
2019-06-27,Williamson,"What we need to talk about is why so many Americans have unnecessary chronic illnesses, so many more compared to other countries. That gets back into not just the big pharma, not just health insurance companies, it has to do with chemical policies, it has to do with environmental-"
2019-06-27,Williamson,Policies.
2019-06-27,Williamson,It has to do with food policies. It has to do with drug policies-
2019-06-27,Williamson,It even has to do with the environmental policies.
2019-06-27,Bennet,"I believe that will get us the quickest way there, and I thought the Vice President was very moving about this and Mayor Pete as well. I had prostate cancer recently, as you may know, and why I was a little race getting in the race. The same week, my kid had her appendectomy out, and I feel very strongly that families ought to be able to have this choice."
2019-06-27,Bennet,"I think thatís what the American people want. I believe it will get us there quickly. There are millions of people in America that do not have health insurance today because they canít. Theyíre too ìwealthyî. They make too much money to be on Medicaid. They canít afford health insurance. When Senator Sanders says that Canada is single pair, there are 35 million people in Canada. There are 330 million people in the United States. Easily the number of people on a public option."
2019-06-27,Bennet,"It could easily be 35 million, and for them, it would be Medicare for All, as Mayor Buttigieg says. But for others that want to keep it, they should be able to keep it. I think that will be the fastest way to get where we need to go. Also-"
2019-06-27,Harris,Iíd like to add a point-
2019-06-27,Bennet,"I will say, Bernie is a very honest person. He has said over and over again- unlike others that have supported this legislation- over and over again, that this will ban, make illegal, all insurance except cosmetic, except insurance forÖ I guess thatís for plastic surgery. Everything else is banned under the Medicare for All proposal, but he is he [crosstalk 00:27:12]-"
2019-06-27,Harris,Iíd like to add a point.
2019-06-27,Harris,I would like to add a point here.
2019-06-27,Sanders,"Just very briefly. You know Mike, Medicare is the most popular health insurance-"
2019-06-27,Bennet,I agree.
2019-06-27,Sanders,"Program in the country. People donít like their private insurance companies. They like their doctors and hospitals. Under our plan, people go to any doctor they want, any hospital they want. We will substantially lower the cost of healthcare in the country because weíll stop the greed of the insurance company [crosstalk 00:27:43]."
2019-06-27,Harris,"-And the reality of how this affects real people is captured in a story that many of us heard, and I will paraphrase. There is- any night in America- a parent whoís seeing that their child has a temperature that is out of control, calls 9-1-1, ìWhat should I do?î They say, ìTake the child to the emergency room.î"
2019-06-27,Harris,"So they get in their car and they drive, and theyíre sitting in the parking lot outside of the emergency room looking at those sliding glass doors, while they have the hand on the forehead of their child knowing that if they walk through those sliding glass doors- even though they have insurance- they will be out of $5,000.00 deductible. $ 5,000.00 deductible when they walk through those doors."
2019-06-27,Harris,Thatís what insurance companies are doing.
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"Because our country is healthier when everybody is healthier. Remember, weíre talking about something people are given a chance to buy into. In the same way that there are undocumented immigrants in my community, who pay. They pay sales taxes, they pay property taxes directly or indirectly. This is not about a handout. This is an insurance program."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"And we do ourselves no favors by having 11 million undocumented people in our country be unable to access healthcare. But of course the real problem is, we should have 11 million undocumented people with no pathway to citizenship. It makes no sense. The American people agree on what to do. This is the crazy thing, if leadership consists of forming a consensus around a device of issueÖ This White House has divided us around a consensus issue."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"The American people want a pathway to citizenship, they wanted protections for Dreamers, we need to clean up the lawful immigration system- like how my father immigrated to this country, and as part of a comprise, we can do whatever common sense measures are needed at the border-"
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,But Washington canít deliver on something the American people want. What does that tell you about the system weíre living in? It tells you-
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,It needs profound structural reform.
2019-06-27,Biden,"Iím sorry, beg your pardon? I didnít hear."
2019-06-27,Biden,"Oh, no I did."
2019-06-27,Biden,Yeah.
2019-06-27,Biden,"Yes, but hereís the thing-"
2019-06-27,Biden,"Yes, you cannot let, as the Mayor said, you cannot let people who are sick- no matter where they come from, no matter what their status, go uncovered. You canít do that. Itís just going to be taken care of period. You have to. Itís the humane thing to do."
2019-06-27,Biden,"But hereís the deal, the deal is that heís right about three things. Number one, they in fact contribute to the wellbeing of the country, but they also, for example, theyíve increased the life span of Social Security because if they have a job, theyíre paying the Social Security tax. Thatís what theyíre doing. Itís increasing the life span."
2019-06-27,Biden,"They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of healthcare by them being able to be treated and not wait until theyíre an extremist. The other thing is, folks, look we can deal with these insurance companies. We can deal with the insurance companies by number one, putting insurance executives in jail for their misleading advertising which theyíre doing on opioids, what theyíre doing paying doctors to prescribe."
2019-06-27,Biden,"We could be doing this by making sure everyone who is on Medicare, that the government should be able to negotiate the price for whatever the drug costs are. We can do this by making sure that weíre in a position that we in fact allow people-"
2019-06-27,Harris,"Immediately, on January 20, 2021, I will first offÖ We cannot forget our DACA recipients, so Iím going to start there. I will immediately, by executive action, reinstate DACA status and DACA protection to those young people. I will further extend protection for deferral of deportation for their parents, and for veterans- who we have so many who are undocumented and have served our country and fought for our democracy."
2019-06-27,Harris,"I will also immediately put in place a meaningful process for reviewing the cases for asylum. I will release children from cages. I will get rid of the private detention centers. And I will ensure that with this microphone that the President of the United States holds in her hand, is used in a way that is about reflecting the values of our country, and not about locking children up, separating them from-"
2019-06-27,Harris,"And not about locking children up, separating them from their parents. And I have to just say that we have to think about this issue in terms of real people. A mother, who pays a coyote to transport her child through their country of origin, through the entire country of Mexico, facing unknown peril, to come here. Why would that mother do that? I will tell you. Because she has decided for that child to remain where they are is worse. But what does Donald Trump do? He says, ìGo back to where you came from.î That is not reflective of our America, and our values, and itís got to end."
2019-06-27,Williamson,Deal with these children.
2019-06-27,Williamson,Iím sorry.
2019-06-27,Williamson,"Yes, what Donald Trump has done to these children, and itís not just in Colorado, Governor, youíre right, it is kidnapping. And itís extremely important for us to realize that. If you forcibly take a child from their parentís arms, youíre kidnapping them. And if you take a lot of children, and you put them in a detainment center, thus inflicting chronic trauma upon them, thatís called child abuse. This is called collective child abuse. And when this is crime, both of those things are a crime, and if your government does it, that doesnít make it less of a crime. These are state sponsored crimes."
2019-06-27,Williamson,"And what President Trump has done, is not only attack these children, not only demonize these immigrants, he is attacking a basic principle of Americaís moral core. We open our hearts to the stranger. This is extremely important. And itís also important for all of us, remember. And I have great respect for everyone who is on this stage, but weíre going to talk about what to do about healthcare? Well, where have you been guys, because itís not just a matter of a plan. And I havenít heard anybody on this stage who has talked about American Foreign policy in Latin America, and how we might have in the last few decades, contributed to something being more helpful."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"Well, one of the worst things about President Trump that heís done to this country, is he has torn apart the moral fabric of who we are. When he started separating children at the border, from their parents, the fact that seven children have died at his custody, the fact that dozens of children have been separated from their parents, and they have no plan to reunite them. So I would do a few things. First I would fight for comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship. Second, I would reform how we treat asylum seekers at the border. I would have a community based treatment center where youíre doing it within the communities, where asylum seekers are given lawyers, where thereís real immigration judges, not employees of the attorney general, but appointed for life, and have a community based system."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"I would fund border security. But the worst thing President Trump has done is heís diverted the funds away from cross border terrorism, cross border human trafficking, drug trafficking, and gun trafficking, and heís given that money to the for-profit prisons. I would not be spending money in for-profit prisons to lock up children and asylum seekers."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"Letís remember thatís not just a theoretical exercise. That criminalization, that is the basis for family separation. You do away with that, itís no longer possible. Of course, it wouldnít be possible anyway in my presidency, because it is dead wrong."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"Weíve got to talk about one other thing, because the Republican party likes to cloak itself in the language of religion. Now, our party doesnít talk about that as much, largely for a very good reason, which was we are committed to the separation of church and state, and we stand for people of any religion, and people of no religion."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"But we should call out hypocrisy when we see it. And for a party that associates itself with Christianity, to say that it is okay to suggest that God would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents, that God would condone putting children in cages, has lost all claim to ever use religious language again."
2019-06-27,Biden,"The first thing I would do, is unite families. Iíd surge immediately, billions of dollars worth of help to the region, immediately."
2019-06-27,Biden,"Look, I talk about foreign policy. Iím the guy that got a bipartisan agreement at the very end of the campaign, at the very end of our term, to spend 740 million dollars to deal with the problem. And that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place. It was working. We saw, as you know, a net decrease in the number of children who were coming. The crisis was abated. And along came this president, and he said heíd immediately discontinue that."
2019-06-27,Biden,"We all talk about these things. I did it. I did it. 740 millionÖ Now look, second thing we have to do. The law now requires that reuniting those families. We would reunite those families, period. And if not, weíd put those children in a circumstance where they were safe, until we could find their parents."
2019-06-27,Biden,"And lastly, the idea that heís in court with his justice department, saying children in cages do not need a bed, do not need a blanket, do not need a toothbrush, that is outrageous, and it should stop."
2019-06-27,Williamson,No.
2019-06-27,Biden,"Depending if they committed a major crime, they should be deported. President Obama, I think, did a heck of a job. To compare him to what this guy is doing is absolutely, I find, close to immoral."
2019-06-27,Biden,"But the fact is, that look, we should not be locking people up. We should be making sure we change the circumstance, as we did, why they would leave in the first place. And those who come seeking asylum, we should immediately have the capacity to absorb them, keep them safe, until they can be heard."
2019-06-27,Biden,That person should not be the focus of deportation. We should fundamentally change the way we deal with things.
2019-06-27,Williamson,I think itís importantÖ
2019-06-27,Sanders,"I want to suggest that I agree with a lot of what Kamala just said. And that is on day one, we take out our executive order pen, and we rescind every damn thing on this issue, that Trump has done."
2019-06-27,Sanders,"Number two, picking up on the point that Joe made. We got to look at the root causes. And you have a situation where Honduras, among other things, is a failing state, massive corruption. Youíve got gangs who are telling families, that if a ten year old does not join that gang, that family is going to be killed."
2019-06-27,Sanders,What we have got to do on day one is invite the Presidents and the leadership of Central America and Mexico together. This is a hemisphere problem that we have got to address.
2019-06-27,Harris,"Well, thank you. I will say no, absolutely not. They should not be deported. And I actuallyÖ This was one of the very few issues with which I disagreed with the administration, with whom I otherwise had great relationship, and a great deal of respect. But on the secure communities issue, I was Attorney General of California. I led the second largest Department of Justice in The United States, second only to The United States Department of Justice in a state of 40 million people. And on this issue, I disagreed with my President, because the policy was to allow deportation of people, who by ICEís own definition were non-criminals."
2019-06-27,Harris,"So as attorney general, and the Chief Law Officer of the state of California, I issued a directive to the sheriffs of my state, that they did not have to comply with detainers, and instead, should make decisions based on the best interest of public safely of their community. Because what I saw, and I was tracking it every day, I was tracking it and saw that parents, people who had not committed a crime, even by ICEís own definition, were being deported."
2019-06-27,Harris,"But I have to add a point here. The problem with this kind of policy, and I know it as a prosecutor. I want rape victim to be able to run in the middle of the street and wave down a police officer and report the crime against her. I want anybody who has been the victim of any real crime to be able to do that, and not be afraid that if they do that, they will be deported, because the abuser will tell them it is they who is the criminal. It is wrong. It is wrong."
2019-06-27,Bennet,"I think that first of all, the biggest threat to our national security right now is Russia, not China. And second, on China, weíve got competitionÖ Because of what theyíve done with our election. In China, I think the Presidentís been right to push back on China, but has done it in completely the wrong way."
2019-06-27,Bennet,"We should mobilize the entire rest of the world, who all have a shared interest in pushing back on Chinaís mercantilist trade policies, and I think we can do that."
2019-06-27,Bennet,"Iíd like to answer the other question before this, as well."
2019-06-27,Bennet,"When I see these kids at the border, I see my mom, because I know she sees herself, because she was separated from her parents for years during the Holocaust in Poland."
2019-06-27,Bennet,"And for Donald Trump to be doing what heís doing to children and their families at the bordersÖ I say this as somebody who wrote the immigration bill in 2013, that created a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people in this country, that had the most progressive Dream Act thatís every been conceived, much less passed. It got 68 votes in the Senate. That had 46 billion dollars of border security in it. That was sophisticated 21st Century border security, not a medieval wall."
2019-06-27,Bennet,"And the President has turned the border of the United States into a symbol of nativist hostility, that the whole world is looking at, when what we should be represented by, is the Statue of Liberty, which has brought my parents to this country to begin with. We need to make a change."
2019-06-27,Yang,"Well, I just want to agree that I think Russia is our greatest geopolitical threat, because theyíve been hacking our democracy successfully, and theyíve been laughing their asses off about it for the last couple of years. So we should focus on that before we start worrying about other threats."
2019-06-27,Yang,"Now, China, they do pirate our intellectual property. Itís a massive problem. But the tariffs and the trade war are just punishing businesses and producers and workers on both sides. I met with a farmer in Iowa who said he spent six years building up a buying relationship in China thatís now disappeared and gone forever. And the beneficiaries have not been American workers or people in China. Itís been Southeast Asia and other producers that have then stepped into the void."
2019-06-27,Yang,"So we need to crack down on Chinese malfeasance in the trade relationship, but the tariffs and the trade war are the way to go."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"First of all, weíve got to recognize that the China challenge really is a serious one. This is not something to dismiss or wave away. And if you look at what China is doing, theyíre using technology for the perfection of dictatorship. But their fundamental economic model isnít going to change because of some tariffs."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"I live in the industrial Midwest. Folks who arenít in the shadow of a factory, or somewhere near a soy field where I live. And manufacturers, and especially soy farmers, are hurting. Tariffs are taxes, and Americans are going to pay on average 800 dollars more a year, because of these tariffs."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"Meanwhile, China is investing, so that they could soon be able to run circles around us in artificial intelligence. And this President is fixated on the kind of relationship as if all that mattered was the export balance on dishwashers. Weíve got a much bigger issue on our hands."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"But in a moment when their authoritarian model is being held up as an alternative to ours, because ours looks so chaotic compared to theirs right now, because of our internal divisions, the biggest thing weíve got to do is invest in our own domestic competitiveness."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"If we disinvest in our own infrastructure, education, we are never going to be able to compete. And if we really want to be an alternative, a democratic alternative, we actually have to demonstrate that we care about democratic values at home and around the world."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,Because I couldnít get it done. My community is in anguish right now because of an officer-involved shooting. A black man Eric Logan killed by a white officer. Iím not allowed to take sides until the investigation comes back. The officer says he was attacked with a knife but he didnít have his body camera on. Itís a mess. Weíre hurting.
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"I could walk you through all of the things we have done as a community, all of the steps that we took from bias training to deescalation but it didnít save the life of Eric Logan. When I look into his motherís eyes I have to face the fact that nothing that I say will bring him back."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"This is an issue that is facing our community and so many communities around the country. Until we move policing out from the shadow of systemic racism, whatever this particular incident teaches us, we will be left with the bigger problem of the fact that thereís a wall of mistrust put up one racist act at a time. Not just from whatís happened in the past but from whatís happening around the country in the present."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"It threatens the wellbeing of every community. I am determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle, when they see a police officer approaching feels the exact same thing. A feeling not of fear but of safety."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,I am determined to bring that day about.
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"Iíve got to respond to that. Look, weíve taken so many steps towards police accountability. The FOP just denounced me for too much accountability. Weíre obviously not there yet. I accept responsibility for that because I am in charge."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"Under Indiana law, this will be investigated and there will be accountability for the officer involved."
2019-06-27,Williamson,"All of these issues are extremely important but there are specifics. There are symptoms. The underlying cause has to do with deep, deep, deep realms of racial injustice both in our criminal justice system and in our economic system."
2019-06-27,Williamson,The Democratic party should be on the side of reparations for slavery for this very reason. I do not believe that the average American is a racist but the average American is woefully undereducated about the history of race in the United States.
2019-06-27,Harris,[crosstalk 00:03:48] stage I would like to speak on the issue of race.
2019-06-27,Harris,What I will say is that I [crosstalk 00:03:57].
2019-06-27,Harris,"Okay. On the issue of race I couldnít agree more that this is an issue that is still not being talked about truthfully and honestly. There is not a black man I know, be he a relative, a friend, or a coworker who has not been the subject of some form of profiling or discrimination."
2019-06-27,Harris,Growing up my sister and I had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents said couldnít play with us because we were black.
2019-06-27,Harris,I will say also that in this campaign weíve also heard Ö Iím going to now direct this at Vice President Biden. I do not believe you are a racist. I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground.
2019-06-27,Harris,I also believe Ö Itís personal. It was actually hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.
2019-06-27,Harris,It was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose busing. There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools. She was bused to school every day. That little girl was me.
2019-06-27,Harris,"I will tell you that on this subject it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly. As Attorney General of California, I was very proud to put in place a requirement that all my special agents would wear body cameras and keep those cameras on."
2019-06-27,Biden,"Itís a mischaracterization of my position across the board. I do not praise racists. That is not true. Number one. Number two, if we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether I did or not Iím happy to do that."
2019-06-27,Biden,"I was a public defender. I didnít become a prosecutor. I came out and I left a good law firm to become a public defender when, in fact, my city was in flames because of the assassination of Dr. King. Number one."
2019-06-27,Biden,"Now number two as the Vice President of the United States I work with a man who, in fact, we worked very hard to see to it we dealt with these issues in a major, major way."
2019-06-27,Biden,The fact is in terms of busing the busing I never Ö You would have been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council. Thatís fine. Thatís one of the things I argued for that we should be breaking down these lines.
2019-06-27,Biden,"The bottom line here is, look, everything Iíve done in my career Ö I ran because of civil rights. I continue to think we have to make fundamental changes in civil rights. Those civil rights, by the way, include not just only African-Americans but the LGBT community."
2019-06-27,Harris,"Vice President Biden, do you agree today, do you agree today, that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then?"
2019-06-27,Biden,No.
2019-06-27,Harris,Do you agree?
2019-06-27,Biden,I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education. Thatís what I opposed. I did not oppose Ö
2019-06-27,Harris,"Well, there was a failure of states to integrate public schools in America. I was part of the second class to integrate Berkeley, California public schools almost two decades after Brown v. Board of Education."
2019-06-27,Biden,Because your city council made that decision. It was a local decision.
2019-06-27,Harris,Thatís where the federal government must step in.
2019-06-27,Biden,[crosstalk 00:07:55].
2019-06-27,Harris,Thatís why we have the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act. Thatís why we need to pass the Equality Act. Thatís why we need to pass the ERA because there are moments in history where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people.
2019-06-27,Biden,I have supported the ERA from the very beginning when I ran [crosstalk 00:08:09].
2019-06-27,Biden,"I supported the ERA from the very beginning. Iím the guy that extended the Voting Rights Act for 25 years. We got to the place where we got 98 of the 98 votes in the United States Senate doing it. Iíve also argued very strongly that we, in fact, deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box. I agree that everybody wants Ö Anyway, my time is up. Iím sorry."
2019-06-27,Williamson,All of these things have to do [crosstalk 00:08:36].
2019-06-27,Sanders,"No. Absolutely not. Unlike the Republican party, we encourage diversity, we believe in diversity. Thatís what America is about. In addition to diversity in terms of having more women, more people from the LGBT community, we also have to do something else."
2019-06-27,Sanders,That is we have to ask ourselves a simple question. How come today the worker in the middle of our economy is making no more money than he or she made 45 years ago and that in the last 30 years the top 1% has seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth.
2019-06-27,Sanders,We need a party that is diverse but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interests who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country.
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"Well, first of all, where Bernie left off weíve heard a lot of good ideas on this stage tonight and a lot of plans. The truth is until you go to the root of the corruption the money in politics, the fact that Washington is run by the special interests, you are never going to solve any of these problems."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"I have the most comprehensive approach that experts agree is the most transformative plan to actually take on political corruption, to get money out of politics, through publicly- funded elections, to have clean elections."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"If we do that and get money out of politics we can guarantee healthcare as a right, not a privilege. We can deal with institutional racism, we can take on income inequality, and we can take on the corporate corruption that runs Washington."
2019-06-27,Biden,The first Constitutional amendment to do that was introduced by me when I was a young senator.
2019-06-27,Bennet,"Gridlock will not magically disappear as long as Mitch McConnell is there, first. Second, thatís why it is so important for us to win not just the presidency, to have somebody that can run in all 50 states, but to win the Senate as well."
2019-06-27,Bennet,"Thatís why we have to propose policies that can be supported like Medicare so that we can build a broad coalition of Americans to overcome broken Washington, DC. I agree with what Senator Gillibrand was saying. I share a lot of her views."
2019-06-27,Bennet,We need to end gerrymandering. We need to end political gerrymandering in Washington. The court today said they couldnít do anything about it. We need to overturn Citizens United. The court was the one that gave us Citizens United and the attack on voting rights in Shelby vs Holder is something we need to deal with.
2019-06-27,Bennet,"All of those things has happened since Vice President Biden was in the Senate. We face structural problems that we have to overcome with a broad coalition. Itís the only way we can do it. We need to root out the corruption in Washington, expand peopleís right to get to the polls, and I think then we can succeed."
2019-06-27,Biden,I have seen what happened. Just since we were Vice President. We needed three votes to pass an $800 recovery act that kept us from going into a depression. I got three votes changed. We needed to be able to keep the government from shutting down and going bankrupt. I got Mitch McConnell to raise taxes $600 billion by raising the top rate.
2019-06-27,Biden,As recently as after President got elected I was able to put together a coalition of [inaudible 00:13:08] that billions of dollars go into cancer research bipartisan.
2019-06-27,Biden,"Sometimes you canít do that. Sometimes you just have to go out and beat them. I went into 20 states, over 60 candidates, and guess what? We beat them. We won back the Senate."
2019-06-27,Bennet,"Chuck, the problem with what the Vice President Ö"
2019-06-27,Bennet,No. The problem Ö
2019-06-27,Bennet,Sometimes you do have to beat them but the deal that he talked about with Mitch McConnell was a complete victory for the Tea Party. It extended the Bush tax cuts permanently. The Democratic party had been running against that for 10 years. We lost that economic argument because that deal extended almost all those Bush tax cuts permanently and put in place the mindless cuts that we still are dealing with today that are called the sequester. That was a great deal for Mitch McConnell. It was a terrible deal for America.
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,[crosstalk 00:14:01].
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,[crosstalk 00:14:02].
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,You heard from the Republicans that the reason why the Trump tax cut had to be passed is because they had to pay back their donors. You heard it. They actually said those words.
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"The corruption in Washington is real. It is something that makes every one of the plans weíve heard about over the last several months impossible. I have the most comprehensive approach to do it with clean elections, publicly-funded elections."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,We restore the power of our democracy into the hands of the voters. Not into the Koch brothers. We were talking about issues. Weíre in Florida. Imagine the Parkland kids having as much power in our democracy as the Koch brothers or the NRA. Imagine their voices carrying farther and wider than anyone else because their voice is needed. [crosstalk 00:14:49].
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"As President, itís the first thing Iím going to do because nothing else is possible, whether itís education or healthcare or ending institutional racism."
2019-06-27,Sanders,"Well, my plan as somebody who believes for a start that a womanís right to control her own body is a constitutional right that government and politicians should not infringe on that right. We will do everything we can to defend Roe vs Wade."
2019-06-27,Sanders,"Second of all, let me make a promise here. You ask about a litmus test. My litmus test is I will never appoint, nominate, any justice to the Supreme Court unless that justice is 100% clear he or she will defend Roe v. Wade."
2019-06-27,Sanders,"Third of all, I do not believe in packing the court. We got a terrible 5-4 majority conservative court right now. I do believe that constitutionally we have the power to rotate judges to other courts. That brings new blood into the Supreme Court and a majority I hope that will understand that a woman has the right to control her own body and that corporations cannot run [crosstalk 00:16:29]."
2019-06-27,Sanders,"Well, first of all, let me tell you this. It didnít even come up yet but letís taste this. Medicare For All guarantees every woman in this country the right to have an abortion if she wants it."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"Can I just address this for a second? I want to talk directly, directly, to Americaís women and the men who love them. Womenís reproductive rights are under assault by President Trump and the Republican party. 30 states are trying to overturn Roe v Wade right now."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"It is mind-boggling to me that we are debating this on this stage in 2019 among Democrats whether women should have access to reproductive rights. I think we have to stop playing defense and start playing offense. Let me tell you one thing about politics because it goes to the corruption and the deal making. When the door is closed and the negotiations are made there are conversations about womenís rights and compromises have been made on our backs. Thatís how we got to Hyde. Thatís how the Hyde Amendment was created, a compromise by leaders of both parties."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"Then we have the ACA. During the ACA negotiation I had to fight like heck with other women to make sure that contraception wasnít sold down the river or abortion services. What we need to know is Ö Imagine this one question. When we beat President Trump and Mitch McConnell walks into the Oval Office, God forbid, to do negotiations who do you want when that door closes to be sitting behind that desk to fight for womenís rights?"
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,I have been the fiercest advocate for womenís reproductive freedom for over a decade. I promise you as president when that door closes I will guarantee womenís reproductive freedom no matter what.
2019-06-27,Harris,"Well, first of all, I donít even call it climate change. Itís the climate crisis. It represents an existential threat to us as a species. The fact that we have a President of the United States who has embraced science fiction over science fact would be to our collective peril."
2019-06-27,Harris,I visited while the embers were smoldering the wildfires in California. I spoke with firefighters who were in the midst of fighting a fire while their own homes were burning.
2019-06-27,Harris,On this issue it is a critical issue that is about what we must do to confront what is immediate and before us right now. That is why I support a Green New Deal. It is why I believe on day one and as president I will reenter us in the Paris Agreement because we have to take these issues seriously.
2019-06-27,Harris,"Frankly, we have a President of the United States Ö We talked about, you asked before what is the greatest national security threat to the United States? Itís Donald Trump."
2019-06-27,Harris,"Iím going to tell you why, Iím going to tell you why, because I agree climate change represents an existential threat. He denies the science. You want to talk about North Korea? A real threat in terms of nuclear arsenal but what does he do? He embraces Kim Jong-Un, a dictator for the sake of a photo op. Putin, you want Ö"
2019-06-27,Harris,Öa dictator for the sake of a photo op.
2019-06-27,Harris,Putin. You want to talk about Russia?
2019-06-27,Harris,He takes the word of the Russian President-
2019-06-27,Harris,Over the word of the American intelligence-
2019-06-27,Harris,Community when it comes to a threat to our democracy-
2019-06-27,Harris,And our elections.
2019-06-27,Harris,"These are the issues that are before us, Chuck."
2019-06-27,Harris,Yes.
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"Well, the reality is, we need to begin adapting right away, but we also canít skip a beat on preventing climate change from getting even worse. Itís why we need aggressive and ambitious measures. Itís why we need to do a carbon tax and dividend, but I would propose we do it in a way that is rebated out to the American people in a progressive fashion so that most Americans are made more than whole."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"This isnít theoretical for us in south Indiana. Parts of California on fire, right here in Florida theyíre talking about sea level rise. Well, in Indiana, I had to activate the Emergency Operations Center of our city twice in less than two years. First time was a 1,000 year flood, and the next time was a 500 year flood. This is not just happening on the Arctic ice caps. This is happening in the middle of the country and weíve got to be dramatically more aggressive moving forward."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"Now hereís what very few people talk about. First of all, rural American can be part of the solution instead of being told theyíre part of the problem. With the right kind of soil management and other kind of investments, rural America could be a huge part of how we get this done. Secondly, we got to look to the leadership of local communities. Those networks of mayors-"
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,Of cities from around the world who-
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"Have come together, not even waiting for our national governments to catch up. We should have a Pittsburgh Summit where we bring them together as well as rejoining the Paris-"
2019-06-27,Biden,"The answer is yes. Number one, when our administration, we built the largest wind farm in the world, the largest solar energy facility in the world. We drove down the price, competitive price, of both of those renewable sources. I would immediately insist that we, in fact, build 500,000 recharging stations throughout the United States of America, working with Governors, Mayors, and others, so that we can go to a full electric vehicle future by the year 2030."
2019-06-27,Biden,"I would make that we invested $400 million dollars in new science and technology to be the exporter, not only of the green economy, but economy that can create millions of jobs. But I would immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord. I would up the ante in that Accord, which it calls for, because we make up 15% of the problem. 85% of the world makes up the rest. We have to have someone that knows how to corral the rest of the world, bring them together, and get something done like we did in our administration."
2019-06-27,Sanders,"Look, the old ways are no longer relevant. The scientists tell us we have 12 years before there is irreparable damage to this planet. This is a global issue. What the President of the United States should do is not deny the reality of climate change, but tell the rest of the world that instead of spending a trillion and a half dollars on weapons of destruction, let us get together for the common enemy, and that is to transform the world energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy."
2019-06-27,Sanders,The future of the planet rests on us doing that. [crosstalk 00:25:22]
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,Hereís the solution. Pass the torch. Pass the torch to the generation thatís going to feel the effects of climate change.

2019-06-27,Sanders,We need a political revolution. People have got to stand up-
2019-06-27,Sanders,And take on the special interests. We can transform this country.
2019-06-27,Biden,"I think youíre so underestimating what Barack Obama did. Heís the first man to bring together the entire world, 196 nations, to commit to deal with climate change immediately, so I donít buy that, but the first thing I would do is make sure that we defeat Donald Trump."
2019-06-27,Biden,Period.
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"We got to fix our democracy before itís too late. Get that right, climate, immigration, taxes, and every other issue gets better."
2019-06-27,Yang,"I would pass a $1,000 freedom dividend for every American adult starting at age 18, which would speed us up on climate change, because if you get the boot off of peopleís throats, theyíll focus on climate change much more clearly."
2019-06-27,Williamson,"My first call is to Prime Minister of New Zealand, who said that her goal is to make New Zealand the place where itís the best place in the world for a child to grow up.

2019-06-27,Sanders,No.
2019-06-27,Sanders,Thatís a mis-characterization of my thinking.
2019-06-27,Sanders,"Look, we have a gun crisis right now. 40,000 people a year are getting killed. In 1988, Rachel, when it wasnít popular, I ran on a platform of banning assault weapons, and in fact, lost that race for Congress. I have a D minus voting record from the NRA and I believe that what we need is comprehensive gun legislation that, among other things, provides universal background. We end the gun show loophole. We end the straw man provision. I believed in 1988, and I believe today that assault weapons [crosstalk 00:36:53] are weapons are from the military and that they should not be on the streets of America."
2019-06-27,Sanders,We ban the sale and distribution-
2019-06-27,Sanders,And thatís what I believed for many years-
2019-06-27,Sanders,"If the government wants to do that, if people want to bring them back-"
2019-06-27,Sanders,Yes.
2019-06-27,Harris,"Thank you. I think your idea is a great one, Congressman Swalwell. I will say that there a lot of great ideas. The problem is Congress has not had the courage to act, which is why when elected President of the United States, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to pull their act together, bring all these good ideas together, and put a bill on my desk for signature. If they do not, I will take executive action, and I will put in place the most comprehensive background check policy weíve had. I will require the ATF to take the licenses of gun dealers who violate the law, and I will ban, by executive order, the importation of assault weapons, because Iím going to tell you, as a prosecutor, I have seen more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you. I have hugged more mothers who are the mothers of homicide victims. I have attended more police officer funerals. It is enough. It is enough. There have been plenty of good ideas from members of the United States Congress. Thereís been no action. As President, I will take action."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"Yes, of course, because we trained on some of these kinds of weapons. Look, every part of my life experience informs this. Being the Mayor of a city where the worst part of the job is dealing with violence, we lose as many as were lost at Parkland every two or three years in my city alone. This is tearing communities apart."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"If more guns made us safer, weíd be the safest country on earth. It doesnít work that way. Common sense measures like universal background checks canít seem to get delivered by Washington, even when most Republicans, let alone most Americans, agree itís the right thing to do. As somebody who trained on weapons of war, I can tell you that there are weapons that have absolutely no place in American cities or neighborhoods in peace time, ever."
2019-06-27,Biden,A real 30 seconds?
2019-06-27,Biden,"Okay. Iím the only person thatís beaten the NRA nationally. Iím the guy that got the Brady Bill passed, the background checks, number one. Number two, we increase that background check [inaudible 00:39:49] during the Obama-Biden administration. Iím also the only guy that got assault weapons banned. Banned. And the number of clips in a gun banned. So folks, look, and I would buyback those weapons. We already started talking about that. We tried to get it done. I think-"
2019-06-27,Biden,"Ö As weapons. We already started talking about that. We tried to get it done. I think it can be done and it should be demanded that we do it, and thatís a good expenditure of money. And lastly, we should have smart guns. No gun should be able to be sold unless your biometric measure could pull that trigger. Itís within our right to do that, we can do that. Our enemy is the gun manufacturers, not the NRA. The gun manufacturers."
2019-06-27,Bennet,"Thank you very much. What an excellent question. First of all, we have to restore our democracy out home. The rest of the world is looking for us for leadership. We have a president who doesnít believe in the rule of law, he doesnít believe in freedom of the press, he doesnít believe in independent judiciary. He believes in the corruption that heís brought to Washington D.C., and that is what we have to change, and thatís why everybody is up here tonight. And I appreciate the fact that theyíre up here for that reason."
2019-06-27,Bennet,"Second, weíve got to restore the relationships that heís destroyed with our allies. Not just in Europe, he flew to the G20 last night and attacked Japan, Germany, and a third ally of ours without saying anything about North Korea or Russia. When youíve got a situation where you have a president who says something happened in the Straits of Hormuz and the whole world doesnít know whether to believe it or not, that is a huge problem when it comes to the national security of the United States of America."
2019-06-27,Bennet,And we need to change that.
2019-06-27,Williamson,"Well, one of my first phone calls would be to call the European leaders and say, ìWeíre back.î Because I totally understand-"
2019-06-27,Williamson,Ö that the United States be part of the Western Alliance.
2019-06-27,Yang,"China, we need to cooperate with them on climate change, AI, and other issues. North Korea."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"We have no idea which of our most important allies he will have pissed off worse between now and then. What we know is that our relationship with the entire world needs to change, and it starts by modeling American values at home."
2019-06-27,Biden,We know NATO will fall apart if heís elected four more years. Itís the single most consequential alliance in the history of the United States.
2019-06-27,Sanders,"Itís not one country. I think it is rebuilding trust in the United Nations, and understand that we can solve conflicts without war, but with diplomacy."
2019-06-27,Harris,All the members of the NATO alliance.
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"President Trump is hellbent on starting a war with Iran. My first act will be to engage Iran to stabilize the Middle East and make sure we do not start and unwanted, never-ending war."
2019-06-27,Bennet,Our European allies and every Latin American country thatís willing to have a conversation about how to deal with the refugee [inaudible 00:43:59].
2019-06-27,Bennet,Thatís a good plan.
2019-06-27,Biden,"Because once the Bush abused that power. What happened was we got elected after that. I made sure the President turned to me and said, ìJoe, get our combat troops out of Iraq.î I was responsible for getting 150,000 combat troops out of Iraq and my son was one of them. I also think we should not have combat troops in Afghanistan. Itís long overdue. It should end. And thirdly, I believe that youíre not going to find anybody who has pulled together more of our alliances to deal with with what is the real stateless threat out there. We cannot go it alone in terms of dealing with terrorism. So, Iíd eliminate the act that allowed us to go into war and not the AUMF, and make sure that it could only be used for what itís intent was, and that is to go after terrorists. But never do it alone."
2019-06-27,Biden,"Thatís why we have to repair our alliances. We put together 65 countries to make sure we dealt with ISIS in Iraq and other places. Thatís what I would do, thatís what I have done. And I know how to do it."
2019-06-27,Sanders,"One of the differences Ö One of the differences that Joe and I have in our record is Joe voted for that war. I helped lead the opposition to that war, which is a total disaster. Second of all, I helped lead the effort for the first time to utilize the War Powers Act, to get the United States out of the sorely- led intervention in Yemin, which is the most horrific humanitarian disaster on Earth. And thirdly, let me be very clear, I will do everything I can to prevent a war with Iran, which would be far worse than disastrous war with Iraq."
2019-06-27,Biden,You canít go to war without informed consent of the American people.
2019-06-27,Williamson,"Iím sorry we havenít talked more tonight about how weíre going to beat Donald Trump. I have an idea about Donald Trump. Donald Trump is not going to be beaten just by insider politics talk. Heís not going to be beaten just by somebody who has plans. Heís going to be beaten by somebody who has an idea of what this man has done. This man has reached into the psyche of the American people and heís harnessed fear for political purposes. So, Mr. President, if youíre listening, I want you to hear me please. You have harnessed fear for political purposes and only love can cast that out. So, I, sir, I have a feeling you know what youíre doing. Iím going to harness love for political purposes. I will meet you on that field and sir, love will win."
2019-06-27,Bennet,"Thank you. Thank you. My mom and her parents came to the United States to rebuilt their shattered lives in the only country that they could. 300 years before that, my parentís family came searching religious freedom here. The ability for one generation to do better than the next is now severely at risk in the United States, especially among children living in poverty like the ones I used to work for in the Denver public schools. Thatís why Iím running for president. Iíve had two tough races in Colorado, but by bringing people people together, not by making empty promises. And I believe we need to build a broad coalition of Americans to beat Donald Trump, end the corruption in Washington, and build a new era of American democracy and American opportunity."
2019-06-27,Bennet,"This is going to be hard to do, but itís what our parentís would have expected, itís what our kids deserve."
2019-06-27,Bennet,I hope youíll join me in this effort. Thank you.
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"Women in America Ö Women in America are on fire. Weíve marched, weíve organized, weíve run for office, and weíve won. But our rights are under attack like never before by President Trump and the Republicans who want to repeal Roe v. Wade, which is why I went to the front lines in Georgia to fight for them. As president, I will take on the fights that no one else will. I stood up to the Pentagon and repealed Donít Ask, Donít Tell. Iíve stood up to the banks and voted against the bailout twice. Iíve stood up to Trump more than any other senator in the U.S. Senate and I have the most comprehensive approach for getting money out of politics with publicly-funded elections to deal with political corruption."
2019-06-27,Gillibrand,"Now is not the time to play it safe. Now is not the time to be afraid of first. We need a president who will take on the big challenges, even if she stands alone. Join me in fighting for this."
2019-06-27,Yang,"First, I want to thank everyone who put me on this stage tonight. I am proof that our democracy still works. Democrats and Americans around the country have one question for their nominee, and that is, ìWho can beat Donald Trump in 2020?î That is the right question and the right candidate to beat Donald Trump will be solving the problems that got Donald Trump elected, and will have a vision of a trickle-up economy that is already drawing thousands of disaffected Trump voters, conservatives, independents, and libertarians, as well as democrats and progressives. I am that candidate. I can build a much broader coalition to beat Donald Trump. It is not left, it is not right, it is forward, and that is where Iíll talk the country in 2020."
2019-06-27,Harris,"Thank you. I just want to leave you with a couple of things. One, we need a nominee who has the ability to prosecute the case against four more years of Donald Trump and I will do that. Second, this election is about you. This is about your hopes, and your dreams, and your fears, and what wakes you up at three oíclock in the morning. Thatís why I have what I call a 3:00 a.m. agenda that is about everything from what we need to do to deliver healthcare to how you will be able to pay the bills by the end of the month. When I think about what our country needs, I promise you I will be a president who leads with a sense of dignity, with honesty, speaking the truth, and giving the American family all that they need to get through the end of the month in a way that allows them to prosper."
2019-06-27,Harris,"So, I hope to earn your support. Please join us kamalaharris.org."
2019-06-27,Buttigieg,"Nothing about politics is theoretical for me. Iíve had the experience of writing a letter to my family, putting it in an envelope marked ìjust in caseî, and leaving it where they would know where to find it in case I didnít come back from Afghanistan. Iíve experience with being in a marriage that exists by the grace of a single vote on the U.S. Supreme Court. I have the experience of guiding a community where the per capita income was below $20,000 when I took office into a brighter future. Iím running because the decisions we make in the next three or four years are going to decide how the next 30 or 40 go. When I get to the current age of the current president in the year 2055, I want to be able to look back on these years and say, ìMy generation delivered climate solutions, racial equality, and an end to endless war.î Help me deliver that new generation to Washington before itís too late."
2019-06-27,Sanders,"I suspect people all over the country who are watching this debate are saying, ìThese are good people. They have great ideas.î But how come nothing really change? How come for the last 45 years wages have been stagnant for the middle class? How come we have the highest rate of childhood poverty? How come 45 million people still have student debt? How come three people own more wealth than the bottom half of America? And here is the answer. Nothing will change unless we have the guts to take on Wall Street, the insurance industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the military industrial complex, and the fossil fuel industry. If we donít have the guts to take them on, weíll continue to have plans, weíll continue to have talk, and the rich will get richer, and everybody else will be struggling."
2019-06-27,Biden,Thank you very much. Iím ready to lead this country because I think itís important we restore the soul of this nation. This president has ripped it out. Heís the only president in our history who has equated racist and white supremacist with ordinary and decent people. Heís the only president who has in fact engaged and embraced dictators and thumbed their nose at our allies. Iím secondly running for president because I think we have to restore the backbone of America. The poor and hardworking middle class people. You canít do that without replacing them with the dignity they once had.
2019-06-27,Biden,"Lastly, weíve got to unite the United States of America as much as anybody says we canít. If we do, thereís not a single thing the American people canít do. This is the United States of America. We can do anything if weíre together. Together. So, God bless you all and may God protect our troops."
2019-06-26,Warren,Thank you. Itís good to be here.
2019-06-26,Warren,"I think of it this way. Who is this economy really working for? Itís doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top. Itís doing great for giant drug companies. Itís just not doing great for people who are trying to get a prescription filled. Itís doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons, just not for the African Americans and Latinx whose families were torn apart, whose lives are destroyed and whose communities are ruined."
2019-06-26,Warren,"Itís doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us. When youíve got a government, when youíve got an autonomy that does great for those with money and isnít doing great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple. We need to call it out. We need to attack it head on, and we need to make structural change in our government, in our economy, and in our country."
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"Well, first the economy. We know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity and Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about whatís going on when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums. I do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids. I do. But I think my plan is a good one, and my plan would be to first of all make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile gets help with their education. My own dad and my sister got their first degrees with community college. Thereís many paths to success, as well as certifications."
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"Secondly, Iíd use Pell Grants. Iíd double them from $6,000 to $12,000 a year and expand it to the number of families that get covered up to families that make up to $100,000. Then the third thing I would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans. Because I can tell you this, if billionaires can pay off their yachts, students should be able to pay off their student loans."
2019-06-26,Booker,"I donít think I disagree. I think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation. you see the evidence of that in how dignity is being stripped from Labor. We have people that work full-time jobs and still canít make a living wage. We see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs, and you see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy thatís hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete."
2019-06-26,Booker,"One of the most aggressive bills in the Senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector. I feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work. Iíll tell you this. I live in a low income black and brown community. I see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans. The indicators that are being used from GDP to Wall Streetís rankings is not helping people in my community. It is about time that we have economy that works for everybody, not just the wealthiest in our nation."
2019-06-26,Booker,"Well again, I will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that. When it comes to antitrust law, what I will do is number one, appoint judges that will enforce it. Number two, have a DOJ and a Federal Trade Commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration. At the end of the day, we have too much of a problem with corporate power growing. We see that with everything from Citizens United and the way theyíre trying to influence Washington. Itís about time that we have a President that fights for the people in this country."
2019-06-26,Booker,We need to have someone thatís a champion for them.
2019-06-26,Warren,"The way I understand this is there is way too much consolidation now in giant industries in this country. That hurts workers. It hurts small businesses. It hurts independent farmers. It hurts our economy overall, and it helps constrict real innovation and growth in this economy. Now look, weíve had the laws out there for a long time to be able to fight back. Whatís been missing is courage, courage in Washington to take on the giants. Thatís part of the corruption in this system."
2019-06-26,Warren,"It has been for too long that the monopolies have been making the campaign contributions, have been funding the Super PACs, have been out there making sure that their influence is heard and felt in every single decision that gets made in Washington. Where I want to start this is I want to return government to the people and that means calling out the names of the monopolies and saying, ìI have the courage to go after them.î"
2019-06-26,Castro,"Thank you very much for that question, Lester. I grew up with a mother who raised my brother Joaquin and me as a single parent, and I know what itís like to struggle. I know what itís like to rent a home and to worry about whether youíre going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month, and to see a mom work very, very hard and know that moms across this country are getting paid less simply because theyíre women. I would do several things, starting with something we shouldíve done a long time ago, which is to pass the Equal Rights Amendment finally in this country and also pursue legislation so that women are paid equal pay for equal work in this country. Itís past time that we did that and we have to do this. If we want to be the most prosperous nation in the 21st century, we need to make sure that women are paid what they deserve."
2019-06-26,Gabbard,"Well, first of all, letís recognize the situation weíre in, that the American people deserve a president who will put your interests ahead of the rich and powerful. Thatís not what we have right now. I enlisted in the Army National Guard after the al-Qaeda terror attacks on 9/11, so I could go after those who had attacked us on that day. I still serve as a Major, served over 16 years, deployed twice in the Middle East and in Congress, serve on the Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees for over six years."
2019-06-26,Gabbard,"I know the importance of our national security, as well as the terribly high cost of war, and for too long our leaders have failed us, taking us from one regime change war to the next, leading us into a new cold war, an arms race costing us trillions of our hard earned taxpayer dollars and countless lives. This insanity must end. As President I will take your hard earned taxpayer dollars and instead invest those dollars into serving your needs. Things like healthcare, a green economy, good paying jobs, protecting our environment, and so much more."
2019-06-26,de Blasio,"Well, weíve been addressing income inequality in New York City by raising wages, by raising benefits, by putting money back in the hands of working people. $15 minimum wage, paid sick days, Pre-K for All, things that are making a huge difference in working peopleís lives. But let me tell you what weíre hearing here already in the first round of questions is that battle from the heart and soul of our party. I want to make it clear, this is supposed to be the party of working people."
2019-06-26,de Blasio,"Yes, weíre supposed to be for 70% tax rate on the wealthy. Yes, weíre supposed to be for free college, free public college for our young people. We are supposed to break up big corporations when theyíre not serving our democracy. This Democratic Party has to be strong and bold and progressive, and in New York weíve proven that we can do something very different."
2019-06-26,de Blasio,"We can put money back in the hands of working people, and let me tell you, every time you talk about investing in people in their communities, you hear folks say, ìThereís not enough money.î What I say to them every single time is, ìThereís plenty of money in this world. Thereís plenty of money in this country. Itís just in the wrong hands.î We Democrats have to fix that."
2019-06-26,Delaney,"I think we need to do real things to help American workers and the American people, right? This is the issue that all of us here on the campaign trail. We need to make sure everyone has a living wage and Iíve called for a doubling of the Earned Income Tax Credit, raising the minimum wage and creating paid family leave. That will create a situation where people actually have a living wage. That gets right to workers. Then weíve got to fix our public education system. Itís not delivering the results our kids needs, nor is college and post high school career and technical training programs doing that."
2019-06-26,Delaney,"Iím very different than everyone else here on this stage. Prior to being in Congress, I was an entrepreneur. I started two businesses. I created thousands of jobs. I spent my whole career helping small to mid size businesses all over the country. 5,000 of them I supported. The Obama administration gave me an award for lending to disadvantaged communities. I know how to create jobs. We need to a short term strategy, which is to put money in the pockets of workers with the Earned Income Tax Credit, raising the minimum wage and creating paid family leave, and then we need to have a longterm strategy to make sure this country is competitive and weíre creating jobs everywhereñ"
2019-06-26,Delaney,Ö in this country.
2019-06-26,Inslee,"Well, Iím a little bit surprised. I think plans are great, but Iím a governor, and we got to realize the people who brought us the weekend unions [inaudible 00:13:28] going to bring us a long overdue raise in America. Iím proud of standing up for unions. Iíve got a plan to reinvigorate collective bargaining so we can increase wages finally. I marched with the [inaudible 00:13:27] folks. It is not right that the CEO of McDonaldís makes 2,100 times more than the people slinging hash at McDonaldís. The next thing Iíll do is put people to work in the jobs of the present and the future."
2019-06-26,Inslee,"Look at, Donald Trump is simply wrong. He says wind turbines cause cancer. We know they cause jobs, and we know that we can put millions of people to work in the clean energy jobs of the future. Carpenters, IBWís members, machinists. Weíre doing it in my state today, and then we can do what America always does: lead the world and invent the future and put people to work. Thatís what weíre going to do."
2019-06-26,Warren,"íve had an industrial policy in the United States for decades now, and itís basically been let giant corporations do whatever they want to do. Giant corporations have exactly one loyalty, and that is to profits, and if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to Canada, theyíre going to do it."
2019-06-26,Warren,"Hereís what I propose for an industrial policy. Start with a place where thereís a real need. Thereís going to be a worldwide need for green technology, ways to clean up the air, ways to clean up the water, and we can be the ones to provide that. We need to go 10 fold in our research and development on green energy going forward, and then we need to say, ìAny corporation can come and use that research. They can make all kinds of products from it, but they have to be manufactured right here in the United States of America,î and then we have to double down and sell it around the world. Thereís a $23 trillion market coming for green products. We should be the leaders and the owners and we should have that 1.2 million manufacturing-"
2019-06-26,Warren,Ö jobs here in America. We can do this.
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"Well, I think itís a bold approach. Itís something that Barack Obama wanted to do when we were working on the Affordable Care Act, and that is a public option. I am just simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their health insurance in four years, which is exactly what this bill says."
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"Let me go on beyond that. Thereís a much bigger issue in addition to that and that is pharmaceuticals. The President literally went on TV on Fox and said that peopleís heads would spin when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices. Instead, 2,500 drugs have gone up in double digits since he came into office. Instead he gave $100 billion in giveaways to the pharma companies. For the rest of us, for the rest of America thatís what we call at home all foam and no beer. We got nothing out of it, and so my proposal is to do something about pharma, to take them on, to allow negotiation under Medicare, to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries, and pharma thinks they own Washington. Well they donít own me."
2019-06-26,Warren,"Yes, Iím with Bernie on Medicare for All. Let me tell you why. I spend a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke, and one of the number one reasons is the cost of health care, medical bills. Thatís not just for people who donít have insurance. Itís for people who have insurance. Look at the business model of an insurance company. Itís to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and to pay out as few dollars as possible for your healthcare."
2019-06-26,Warren,"That leaves families with rising premiums, rising copays, and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the healthcare that their doctors say that they and their children need. Medicare for All solves that problem. I understand. There are a lot of politicians who say, ìOh, itís just not possible. We just canít do it. Itís Öî Have a lot of political reasons for this. What theyíre really telling you is they just wonít fight for it. Well, healthcare is a basic human right and I will fight for basic human rights. [crosstalk 00:19:54]"
2019-06-26,de Blasio,"Hey, wait, wait, wait. Congressman OíRourke. Congressman OíRourke. Private insurance is not working for tens of millions of Americans. When you talk about the copays, the deductibles, the premiums, the out of pocket expenses, itís not working."
2019-06-26,de Blasio,How can you defend the system thatís not working?
2019-06-26,de Blasio,Congressman. Youíve got to start by acknowledging the system is not working for people. [crosstalk 00:21:43]
2019-06-26,de Blasio,Why are you defending private insurance [crosstalk 00:21:50].
2019-06-26,Delaney,"[crosstalk 00:21:50] million Americans say they like their private health insurance, by the Way. It should be noted that 100 million Americans Ö I mean I think we should be the party that keeps whatís working and fixes whatís broken. I mean, doesnít that make sense? I mean we should give everyone in this country healthcare as a basic human right for free, full stop. But we should also give them the option to buy private insurance. Why do we have to stand for taking away something from people, and also itís bad policy. If you go to every hospital in this country and you asked them one question, which is how would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the Medicare rate? Every single hospital administrator said they would close."
2019-06-26,Delaney,"The Medicare for All bill requires payments to stay at current Medicare rates. To some extent weíre basically supporting a bill that will have every hospital closed. I mean my dad was a union electrician, right? I actually grew up in a working class family. He loved the healthcare that the IBEW gave him. I just always think about my dad and anything I would do it from a policy perspective. Heíd look at me and heíd say, ìGood job John for getting healthcare for every American-"
2019-06-26,Delaney,Ö but why are you taking my healthcare away?
2019-06-26,Gabbard,Yes.
2019-06-26,Gabbard,"I think weíre talking about this in the wrong way. Youíre talking about one bill over another bill. Really what weíre talking about is our objective. Making sure that every single sick American in this country is able to get the healthcare that they need. I believe Medicare for All is the way to do that. I also think that employers will recognize how much money will be saved by supporting a Medicare for All program, a program that will reduce the administrative costs, reduce the bureaucratic costs, and make sure that everyone gets that quality healthcare that they need. I also think if you look at-"
2019-06-26,Gabbard,"Ö other countries in the world who have universal healthcare, every one of them has some form of a role of private insurance. I think thatís what weíve got to look at, taking the best of these ideas, but making sure unequivocally that no sick American goes without getting the care that they need regardless of how much or little money-"
2019-06-26,Gabbard,Ö they have in their pocket.
2019-06-26,Booker,"I absolutely will. First of all, weíre talking about this as a healthcare issue, but in communities like mine, low income communities [inaudible 00:24:11] an education issue, because kids who donít have health care are not going to succeed in school. It is an issue for jobs and employment because people that do not have good healthcare do not succeed at work. Itís even a retirement issue, because in my community, African Americans have a lower life expectancy because of poor health care and so where I stand is very clear, healthcare is not just a human right, it should be an American right."
2019-06-26,Booker,"I believe the best way to get there is Medicare for All, but I have an urgency about this. When I am President of the United States, Iím not going to wait. We have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care. On this debate, Iím sorry, there are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in America from pharmaceutical companies to insurers. Literally the overhead for insurers that they charge is 15% while Medicareís overhead is only at 2%. We can do this better and every single day I will be fighting to give people more access and more affordable costs until we get to my goal-"
2019-06-26,Booker,Ö which is every American having healthcare.
2019-06-26,Warren,"Let me just ask the Senator. I just want to add to Senator Bookerís point of Ö and that is that the insurance companies, last year alone sucked $23 billion in profits out of the healthcare system $23 billion, and that doesnít count the money that was paid to executives, the money that was spent lobbying Washington. We have a giant industry that wants our healthcare system to stay the way it is because itís not working for families, but itís sure as heck working for them."
2019-06-26,Warren,It is time for us to make-
2019-06-26,Warren,Ö families come first.
2019-06-26,Inslee,"t should not be an option in the United States of America for any insurance company to deny women coverage for their exercise of their right of choice. I am the only candidate here who has passed a law protecting a womanís right of reproductive health and health insurance. Iím the only candidate who has passed a public option. I respect everybodyís goals and plans here, but we do have one candidate thatís actually advanced the ball and we got to have access for everyone. Iíve done it as a public option."
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"I just want to say thereís three women up here that have fought pretty hard for a womanís right to choose, so Iíll start with that. Then I just want to make very clear, I think we share the goal of universal healthcare. The idea I put out there, the public option, which the governor was just talking about, this idea is that you use Medicare or Medicaid without any insurance companies involved. You could do it either way. The estimates are 13 million people would see a reduction in their premiums, 12 more million people would get covered. I think it is a beginning and the way you start and the way you move to universal healthcare."
2019-06-26,Castro,"Yes, it would. I donít believe only in reproductive freedom, I believe in reproductive justice. What that means is just because a woman or lets also not forget someone in the trans communityóa trans female, is poor doesnít mean they shouldnít have the right to exercise that right to choose. I absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion."
2019-06-26,Castro,"More than that everybody in this crowd and watching at home knows that in our country today a persons right to choose is under assault in places like Missouri, in Alabama, in Georgia. I would appoint judges to the federal bench that understand the precedent of Roe v. Wade and would respect it and in addition to that, make sure that we fight hard as we transition our healthcare system to one where everybody can get and exercise that right."
2019-06-26,Warren,"I would make certain that every woman has access to the full range of reproductive healthcare services and that includes birth control. It includes abortion. It includes everything for a woman. I want to add on that itís not enough for us to expect the courts to protect us. 47 years ago, Roe versus Wade was decided and weíve all looked to the courts all that time as state after state has undermined Roe, has put in exceptions, has come right up to the edge of taking away protection-"
2019-06-26,Warren,w have an America where most people support Roe versus Wade. We need to make that a federal law.
2019-06-26,Booker,"They should absolutely be held criminally liable because they are liable and responsible. This is one of The reasons why well before I was running for President, I said I would not take contributions from pharma companies, not take contributions from corporate PACs or pharma executives because they are part of this problem and this opioid addiction in our country. We, in cities like mine, have tried to arrest our way out of addiction for too long. It is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical companies that are responsible help to pay for that."
2019-06-26,Castro,"Thank you very much, Jose. Iím very proud that in April I became the first candidate to put forward a comprehensive immigration plan. And we saw those imagesÖ"
2019-06-26,Castro,"Watching that image of Oscar and his daughter Valeria is heartbreaking. It should also piss us all off. If I were president todayÖ And it should spur us to action. If I were president today, I would sign an executive order that would get rid of Trumpís zero tolerance policy, the Remain in Mexico policy, and the metering policy. This metering policy is basically what prompted Oscar and Valeria to make that risky swim across the river. They had been playing games with people who were coming and trying to seek asylum at our ports of entry. Oscar and Valeria went to a port of entry, and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim. So they got frustrated, and they tried to cross the river. And they died because of that."
2019-06-26,Castro,"On day I would do that executive order that would address metering, and then I would follow that up in my first hundred days with immigration reform that would honor asylum claims that would put undocumented immigrants, as long as they havenít committed a serious crime, on a pathway to citizenship. And that would go to the root cause of the issue, which is we need a Marshall Plan for Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of coming to the United States to seek it."
2019-06-26,Booker,Yes. [inaudible 00:02:43].
2019-06-26,Booker,"On day one I will make sure that number one we end the ICE policies and the customs and border policies that are violating the human rights. When people come to this country, they do not leave their human rights at the border. Number two, I will make sure that we reinstate DACA, that we reinstate pathways to citizenship for DACA recipients, and to make sure that people that are here on temporary protected status can stay and remain here. And then finally, we need to make sure that we address the issues that made Oscar and Valeria come in the first place by making major investments in the northern triangle, not like this president is doing by ripping away the resources we need to actually solve this problem. We cannot surrender our values and then think that weíre going to get border security. We actually will lose security and our values. We must fight for both."
2019-06-26,Castro,"If I might very brieflyÖ And this is an important point. My planÖ And Iím glad to see that Senator Booker, Senator Warren, and Governor Inslee agree with me on this. My plan also includes getting rid of Section 1325 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to go back to the way we used to treat this. When somebody comes across the border, not to criminalize desperation, to treat that as a civil violation. And hereís why itís important. We see all of this horrendous family separation. They use that law, Section 1325, to justify under the law separating little children [crosstalk 00:04:24] from their families."
2019-06-26,Booker,Jose.
2019-06-26,Castro,[crosstalk 00:04:24] And so I want to challenge every single candidate on this stage to support the repeal of Section 1325. [crosstalk 00:04:31].
2019-06-26,Booker,"As my friend here said, I agree with him on that issue. But folks should understand that the separation of children from families doesnít just go on at our border. It happens in our communities as ICE are ripping away parents from their American children, spouses in the light, and are creating fear in cities all across this country where parents are afraid to even drop their kids off to school or go to work. We must end those policies."
2019-06-26,de Blasio,"Jose, we have to change our discussion about immigration [crosstalk 00:04:56] in this county. Because look at the bottom line here. Those tragicÖ That tragic photo of thoseÖ that parent, that childÖ and Iím saying this as a fatherÖ every American should feel that in their heart and every American should say, ìThat is not America. Those are not our values.î But we have to get under the skin of why we have this crisis in our system. Because weíre not being honest about the division thatís been fomented in this country. The way that American citizens have been told that immigrants somehow created their misery and their pain and their challengesÖ"
2019-06-26,de Blasio,"For all the American citizens out there who feel youíre falling behind or feel the American dream is not working for you, the immigrants didnít do that to you. The big corporations did that to you. The 1% did that to you. We need to be the party of working people, and that includes a party of immigrants. But first we have to tell working people in America who are hurting that weíre going to be on their side every single time against those big corporations who created this mess to begin with and remind people weíre all in this together. If we donít change that debate, that politics thatís holding us back, we wonít get all these reforms people are talking about. [crosstalk 00:06:01] Thatís what we need to do is Democrats. [crosstalk 00:00:06:03]."
2019-06-26,Castro,But we have [crosstalk 00:07:21].
2019-06-26,Castro,"Letís be very clear. The reason that theyíre separating these little children from their families is that theyíre using Section 1325 of that act, which criminalizes coming across the border, to incarcerate the parents and then separate them. Some of us on this stage have called to end that section, to terminate it. Some, like congressman OíRourke, have not. And I want to challenge all of the candidates to do that."
2019-06-26,Castro,"I just think itís a mistake, Beto. I think itís a mistake. And I think that that if you truly want to change the system, that we got to repeal that section. If not-"
2019-06-26,Castro,Then it might [crosstalk 00:07:57] as well stay the same policy.
2019-06-26,Castro,Iím not talking about the ones that are seeking asylum. Iím talking about everybody else.
2019-06-26,Castro,Iím still talking about everybody else.
2019-06-26,Castro,Thatís not true.
2019-06-26,Castro,"Iím talking about millions of folks. A lot of folks that are coming are not seeking asylum. A lot of them are undocumented immigrants, right? And you said recently that the reason you didnít want to repeal section 1325 was because you were concerned about human trafficking and drug trafficking. But let me tell you what, Section 18Ö"
2019-06-26,Castro,"Title 18 of the U.S. code, Title 21, and Title 22 already cover human trafficking [crosstalk 00:08:49]."
2019-06-26,Castro,I think that you should do your homework on this issue. If you did your homework on this issue [crosstalk 00:08:56] you would know that we should repeal this section.
2019-06-26,Delaney,Can we talk about the conditions to why people are coming here?
2019-06-26,Delaney,"But rather than talking about specific provisions, we really have to talk about why these people are coming to our country."
2019-06-26,Delaney,And what weíre going to do to actually make a difference in these countries.
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,Yes.
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"Immigrants, they do not diminish America. They are America. And I am happy to look at his proposal, but I do think you want to make sure that you have provisions in place that allow you to go after traffickers and allow you to go after people who are violating the law."
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"What I really think we need to step back and talk about is the economic imperative here. And that is that 70 of our Fortune 500 companies are headed up by people that came from other countries. 25% of our US Nobel laureates were born in other countries. We have a situation right now where we need workers in our fields and in our factories. We need them to start small businesses. We need their ideas, and this president has literally gone backwards at a time where our economy needs immigrants."
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"nd so my proposal is to look at that 2013 bill that passed the Senate with Republican support, to upgrade that bill, to make it as good as possible, and get it done. It brings the debt down by $158 billion."
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"It gives a path to citizenship for citizenÖ for people who can become citizens [crosstalk 00:10:50], and it wouldnít be so much better for our economy in America."
2019-06-26,Booker,"Well, this is a related and brief point. Because what weíre talking about, what Secretary Castro and I are talking about, is that we have the power to better deal with this problem through the civil process than the criminal process. I have been to some of the largest private prisons which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration and their immigration lockups."
2019-06-26,Booker,"Our country has made so many mistakes by criminalizing things, whether itís immigration, whether itís mental illness, whether itís addiction. We know that this is not the way to deal with problems. There is a humane way that affirms human rights and human dignity and actually solve this problem. Donald Trump isnít solving this problem. Weíve seen under his leadership a surge at our border. We solve this problem by making investments in the northern triangle to stop the reasons why people are being driven here in the first place, and we make sure we use our resources to provide health care, to affirm the values and human dignity the people that come here. Because we cannot sacrifice our values, our ideals as a nation for border security. We can have both by doing this the right way."
2019-06-26,Inslee,"There is no reason for the detention and separation of these children. They should be released pending their hearings. And they should have a hearing, and the law should be followed. Thatís what should happen. And we should do what weíre doing in Washington state. Iím proud that weíve passed a law that prevents local law enforcement for being turned into mini ICE agents. Iím proud to have been the first governor to stand up against Donald Trumpís heinous Muslim ban. Iím proud to be a person who is not only talked about dreamers, but being one of the first to make sure that they get a college education so that they can realize their dreams. These are some of the most inspirational people in our state."
2019-06-26,Inslee,"And Iíll leave you with this thought if you want to know what I think. Donald Trump the other day tried to threaten me. He thought it was a threat to tell me that he would send refugees in Washington state if we passed a law that I passed, and I told him thatís not a threat at all. We welcome refugees into our state. We recognize diversity as a strength. This is how we built America. That tradition is going to continue if Iím president of the United States."
2019-06-26,Delaney,ust one more topic. My grandfather was actually separated from his family when he came to this country.
2019-06-26,Booker,"May I address that? First and foremost, it was a mistake to pull out of that deal. And one of the reasons why weíre seeing this hostility now is because Donald Trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation. Literally, he took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout 10, 20 years. And now we see Iran threatening to go further and who are pulledÖ being pulled in further and further into this crisis."
2019-06-26,Booker,"We need to renegotiate and get back into a deal, but Iím not going to have a primary platform to say unilaterally Iím going to rejoin that deal. Because when I am president of the United States, Iím going to do the best I can to secure this country and that region and make sure that if I have an opportunity to leverage a better deal, Iím going to do it."
2019-06-26,Castro,"Yes, it was."
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"It was imperfect, but it was a good deal for that moment. I would have worked to get longer sunset periods, and thatís something we could negotiate to get back in the deal. But the point is, Donald Trump told us when he got out of it that he was going to give us a better deal. Those were his words. And now we are a month away from the Iranians who claim now that theyíre going to blow the caps on enriching uranium, and the Iranians have told us this. And so thatís where we are right now. He has made us less safe than we were when he became president."
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"So what I would do is negotiate us back into that agreement, is stand with our allies, and not give unlimited leverage to China and Russia, which is what he has done. And then finally, I would make sure that if there is any possibility of a conflict, and weíre having this debate in Congress right now, that he comes to Congress for an authorization of military force. I would do that. And this president is literally every single day 10 minutes away from going to war, one tweet away from going to war, and I donít think we should conduct foreign policy [crosstalk 00:17:30] in our bathrobe at five in the morning."
2019-06-26,Gabbard,"Letís deal with the situation where we are, where this president and his chicken hawk cabinet have led us to the brink of war with Iran. I served in the war in Iraq at the height of the war in 2005, a war that took over 4000 of my brothers and sisters in uniformsí lives. The American people need to understand that this war with Iran would be far more devastating, far more costly than anything that we ever saw in Iraq. It would take many more lives, it would exacerbate the refugee crisis, and it wouldnít be just contained within Iran. This would turn into a regional war."
2019-06-26,Gabbard,"his is why itís so important that every one of us, every single American, stand up and say, ìNo war with Iran.î We need to get back into the Iran nuclear agreement, and we need to negotiate how we can improve it. It was an imperfect deal. There are issues like their missile development that needs to be addressed. We can do both simultaneously to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and preventing us from going to war."
2019-06-26,Gabbard,"Obviously if there was an attack against the AmericanÖ our troops, then there would have to be a response. But my point is, and itís important for us to recognize this, is Donald Trump and his cabinet, Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, and others are creating a situation that just a spark would light off a war with Iran, which is incredibly dangerous. Thatís why we need to deescalate tensions. Trump needs to get back into the Iran nuclear deal and swallow his pride. Put the American people first."
2019-06-26,de Blasio,"Hey, but wait a minute. Neither Democrats nor Republicans [crosstalk 00:19:27]"
2019-06-26,de Blasio,Have been serious about the war [crosstalk 00:19:32].
2019-06-26,Delaney,I think itís the prior moderators.
2019-06-26,Warren,Sorry.
2019-06-26,Warren,"So in this period of time that Iíve been running for president, Iíve had more than 100 town halls. Iíve taken more than 2,000 unfiltered questions. And the single hardest question Iíve gottenÖ I got one from a little boy and I got one from a little girl. And that is to say, ìWhen youíre president, how are you going to keep us safe?î Thatís our responsibility as adults. Seven children will die today from gun violence, children and teenagers. And they wonít just die in mass shootings. Theyíll die on sidewalks. Theyíll die in playgrounds. Theyíll die in peopleís backyards. Gun violence is a national health emergency in this country and we need to treat it like that."
2019-06-26,Warren,"So what can we do? We can do the things that are sensible. We can do the universal background checks. We can ban the weapons of war. But we can also double down on the research and find out what really works, where it is that we can make the differences at the margins that will keep our children safe. We need to treat this like the virus thatís killing our children."
2019-06-26,Warren,"So what I think we need to do is we need to treat it like a serious research problem which we have not done. You know, guns in the hands of a collector whoís had them for decades, whoís never firedÖ Who take safety seriously. Thatís very different from guns that are sold and turned over quickly. We canít treat this as an across the board problem. We have to treat it like a public health emergency. That means bring data to bear and it means make real change in this country, whether itís politically popular or not."
2019-06-26,Warren,need to fight for our children.
2019-06-26,Booker,"Well, first of all, I want to say my colleague and I both have been hearing this on the campaign trail. But whatís even worse is I hear gunshots in my neighborhood. I think Iím the only. I hope Iím the only one on this panel here that had seven people shot in their neighborhood just last week. Someone I knew, Shahad Smith, was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year. For millions of Americans, this is not a policy issue, this is an urgency. And for those who have not been directly effected, theyíre tired of living in a country where their kids go to school to learn about reading, writing, and arithmetic, and how to deal with an active shooter in their school."
2019-06-26,Booker,"This is something that Iím tired of. And Iím tired of hearing peopleÖ All they have to offer is thoughts and prayers. In my faith, people say ìFaith without works is dead.î So we will find a way. But the reason we have a problem right now is weíve let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate. It is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda. I will get that done as president of the United States because this is not about policy. This is personal."
2019-06-26,Castro,"Yeah, Rachel, Iím the dad of a 10 year old girl, Carina, whoís here tonight, and the worst thing is knowing that your child might be worried about what could happen at school, a place thatís supposed to be safe. The answer to your question is no, we donít have to accept that. And I believe that on January 20, 2021 at 12:01 pm, weíre going to have a Democratic president, a Democratic House, and a Democratic Senate."
2019-06-26,Castro,"And the activists of Parkland, folks from moms to men who have risen up across the United States and inspired so many people. You know, we may not have seen yet legislative action, but weíre getting closer. The House took a vote. In the Senate, the question often is if the decision is between 60 votes, a filibuster, or passing common sense gun reform, Iím going to choose common sense gun reform. So I believe that weíre going to be able to get that done in 2021."
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"Well thatís not confiscation. You would give them the offer to buy back their gun. But Iíll say this. I look at these proposals and I say, ìDoes this hurt my Uncle Dick and his deer stand?î Coming from a proud hunting and fishing state. These proposals donít do that. When I was a prosecutor, I supported the assault weapon ban. When I was in the senate, I saw those moms from Sandy Hook come and try to advocate for change and we all failed. And then, now these Parkland kids from Florida, they started literally a national shift. You know why? Itís just like with gay marriage. When kids talk to their parents and their grandparents, they say, ìI donít understand why we canít put these sensible things in place.î They listen. And if we get bested by a bunch of 17 year olds, itís the best thing thatíll ever happen. We need to get this done."
2019-06-26,Booker,"Iím going to use 20 of my seconds just to say this. One thing we donít all agree with when it comes to guns, and I think itís common sense and over 70% of Americans agree with meÖ If you need a license to drive a car, you should need a license to buy and own a firearm. And not everybody in this field agrees with that, but in states like Connecticut that did that, they saw 40% drops in gun violence and 15% drops in suicides. We need to start having bold agendas on guns."
2019-06-26,Booker,"When it comes to the Supreme Court, very clearly weÖ I agree with my friend, Secretary Castro, we are going to get to 50 votes in the senate. This is a team sport. Whoever is our nominee needs to campaign in places like South Carolina because we can elect Jaime Harrison. They need to campaign in places like Iowa because we can win a Senate seat there. This is about getting us back to having 50 votes in the Senate and more so that we can not only balance the Supreme Court, but start to pass an aggressive agenda that frankly isnít so aggressive because most of America agrees with the policy objectives of our party."
2019-06-26,Delaney,We have to actually-
2019-06-26,Delaney,This issue is related to-
2019-06-26,de Blasio,"Rachel, I am chief executive of the nationís largest city and I also want to just say something quick on the gun issue and come to your question. Look. I run the largest police force in America too and if weíre going to stop these shootings, if weíre going to get these guns off the street, we have to have a very different relationship between our police and our community. I also want to say that something that sets me apart from all my colleagues running in this race, and that is for the last 21 years Iíve been raising a black son in America. And I have had to have very very serious talks with my son Dante about how to protect himself on the streets of our city and all over this country, including how to deal with the fact that he has to take special caution because there have been too many tragedies between our young men and our police too. As we saw recently in Indiana."
2019-06-26,de Blasio,"So we need to have a different conversation in this country about guns, but also a different conversation about policing that brings police and community together. Weíve done that in New York City and weíve driven down crime while weíve done it."
2019-06-26,de Blasio,"ut to your question about Mitch McConnell, thereís a political solution that we have to come to grips with. If the democratic party would stop acting like the party of the elites and be the party of working people again and go into states, including red states, to convince people weíre on their side, we could put pressure on their Senators to actually have to vote for the nominees that are put forward, decent [inaudible 00:18:56] deserve that right."
2019-06-26,Warren,I do.
2019-06-26,Warren,"I do. We are a democracy. And the way a democracy is supposed to work is the will of the people matters. Now we for far too long have had a congress in Washington that has just completely dismissed what people care about across this country. They have made this country work much better for those who can make giant contributions, made it work better for those who hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers, and not made it work for the people. Well hereís how I see this happening. Number one, sure. I want to see us get a Democratic majority in the senate. But short of the Democratic majority in the senate, you better understand the fight still goes on. It starts in the White House and it means that everybody we energize in 2020 stays on the front lines come January 2021. We have to push from the outside, have leadership from the inside, and make this congress reflect the will of the people."
2019-06-26,Delaney,"I think we need to get things done. Thatís why I believe we need to operate in a bipartisan manner. Listen, Iíll sign into law bills that come to the White House that are passed on a party line basis, absolutely. But all the big, transformative things weíve ever done in this countryís history have happened when huge majorities of the American people get behind them, which is why we need real solutions not impossible promises. We need to put forth ideas that work, whether itís on healthcare, creating universal healthcare so that every American gets healthcare, but not running on making private insurance illegal. The gun issue is related. The gun safety issue is related because I canít tell you how many times Iíve been with folks in western Maryland and theyíve said to me, ìYou know, Democrats donít do anything for us. Republicans donít do anything for us. You fight all the time.î So they vote on that single issue. If we become the party of getting things done for the American people with real solutions no impossible promises-"
2019-06-26,Delaney,Weíll be able to get all these things done.
2019-06-26,Booker,"You know, when I got to the United States Senate, going back to what De Blasio said, as an African American man in an African American dominated community, I knew one of the biggest issues was criminal justice reform. From police accountability to dealing with the fact that we have a nation that has more African Americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850. And when I got to the Senate, people told me we could not get a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill done. As my colleagues in the Senate know, I fought on that bill from the day I got to the Senate. Bill coalitions across the aisle and today we passed the First Step Act. Itís not as far as I want to go, but thousands of people will be liberated. Iíve taken on tough problems people said we cannot achieve and Iíve been able to get things accomplished."
2019-06-26,Inslee,"Yes. First by taking away the filibuster from Mitch McConnell to start with. We have to do that. Look. Look. We are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change and we are the last that can do something about it. Our towns are burning, our fields are flooding, Miami is inundated. And we have to understand this is a climate crisis, an emergency. And it is our last chance in an administration, next one, to do something about it. And we need to do what I have done in my state. Weíve passed a 100% clean electrical grid bill. We now have a vision statement. My plan has been called the gold standard of putting people to work."
2019-06-26,Inslee,"But the most important thing on this, and the biggest decision for the American public is, who is going to make this the first priority? And I am the candidate and the only one whoís saying this has to be the top priority of the United States, the organizing principle to mobilize the United States, so that we can do what weíve always done, lead the world and invent the future and put eight million people to work. Thatís what weíre going to do."
2019-06-26,Castro,"Well, I donít think that that represents the vast majority of the issue. In fact, you know, my first visit after I announced my candidacy wasnít to Iowa or New Hampshire, it was to San Juan, Puerto Rico because people should know that if Iím elected president, everybody will count. And you know, Iím one of the few candidates in this race with executive experience, with a track record of getting things done. When I was mayor of San Antonio, we moved our local public utility. We began to shift it from coal-fired plants to solar and other renewables and also created more than 800 jobs doing that. And when I was HUD Secretary, we worked on the National Disaster Resilience Competition to invest in communities that were trying to rebuild from natural disasters in a sustainable way. Thatís the way that weíre going to help make sure that weíre all safer in the years to come and that we combat climate change. And if Iím elected president, the first thing that I would do, like Senator Klobuchar also said, is sign an executive order recommitting us to the Paris Climate Accord so that-"
2019-06-26,Delaney,The questionís about carbon tax bill-
2019-06-26,Delaney,I introduced the only bipartisan carbon tax bill to Congress-
2019-06-26,Delaney,"All right. All the economists agree that a carbon pricing mechanism works. You just have to do it right. You canít put a price on carbon, raise energy prices, and not give the money back to the American people. My proposal, which is put a price on carbon, give a dividend back to the American people. It goes out one pocket, back in the other-"
2019-06-26,Delaney,I can get that passed my first year as president with a coalition of every Democrat in the Congress and the Republicans who live in coastal states.
2019-06-26,Delaney,"Thereís republicans in Florida, they actually care about this issue."
2019-06-26,Delaney,This has got to be our way forward if weíre actually serious about this issue.
2019-06-26,Gabbard,"Well let me say that there is no one in our government at any level who has the right to tell any American who they should be allowed to love or who they should be allowed to marry. My record in Congress for over six years shows my commitment to fighting for LGBTQ equality. I serve on the equality Caucus and recently voted for passage of the equality act. Maybe many people in this country can relate to the fact that I grew up in a socially conservative home, held views when I was very young that I no longer hold today. Iíve served with LGBTQ service members, both in training and deployed downrange. I know that they would give their life for me and I would give my life for them. It is this commitment that Iíll carry through as president of the United States, recognizing that there are still people who are facing discrimination in the workplace, still people who are unable to find a home for their families. It is this kind of discrimination that we need to address."
2019-06-26,Booker,ut itís not enough. Itís not enough. If I could add to thisÖ Itís very important.
2019-06-26,Booker,"This is not enough. Look. Civil rights is someplace to begin, but in the African American civil rights community, another place to focus on was to stop the lynching of African Americans. We do not talk enough about trans Americans, especially African American trans Americans and the incredibly high rates of murder right now. We donít talk enough about how many children, about 30% of LGBTQ kids who do no go to school because of fear. Itís not enough just to be on the equality act. Iím an original co-sponsor. We need to have a president that will fight to protect LGBTQ Americans every single day from violence in our country."
2019-06-26,Gabbard,"Senator Booker, Senator Booker-"
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"My life and my career and my work in the Senate has been about economic opportunity. And to me, this means better childcare for everyone in this country. And when you want to have an economy that works, you need to have retirement that works, you need to have public schools that work. And you also need to make sure that those communities are able to get those jobs of the future, the STEM jobs. In fact, Donald Trump, one of the first bills that he signed of the 34 he signed where I was the lead DemocratÖ Okay, thatís a first up hereÖ Was one that was about that, making sure minority community members could share in those jobs."
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"So to me, this is about a few things. Itís about an African American woman that goes to a hospital in New Orleans, says her hands are swollen, and then doctor ignores her and her baby dies. Itís about the fact that African-American women make 61 cents for every dollar a white man makes."
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"So in short, we need, to oneÖ And I will do this in my first 100 days as presidentÖ We will work to make sure everyone can vote at this table, everyone can vote in this country and we will also go to the next step of criminal justice reform. Senator Booker and I worked on that First Step Act, but we should go to the Second Step Act, which is to help all our communities across our country."
2019-06-26,Castro,"Well, I also think that we have to recognize racial and social justice. You know, I was in Charleston not too long ago and I remembered that Dylann Roof went to the Mother Emmanuel AME church and he murdered nine people that were worshiping and then he was apprehended by police without incident. Well, but what about Eric Garner and Tamir Rice and Laquan McDonald and Sandra Bland and Pamela Turner and Antonio [inaudible 00:35:03]. Iím proud that Iím the only candidate so far that has put forward legislation that would reform our policing system in America and make sure that no matter the color of your skin is, that youíre treated the same, including Latinos who are mistreated too oftentimes by police."
2019-06-26,de Blasio,"What about the War Powers Act being a part of that equation, with deep respect to the Congressman. Look, weíve learned painful lessons as Americans that weíve gone to war without congressional authorization. And look, this is very personal for me. I know the cost of war. My dad served in the Pacific in World War II in the US Army, Battle of Okinawa, had half his leg blown off and he came home with scars, both physical and emotional, and he did not recover. He spiraled downward and he ultimately took his own life. And that battle didnít kill him, but that war did. And look, even in the humanitarian crisisÖ And I think we should be ready, Congressman, to intervene god forbid there is a genocide, but not without congressional approval. Democrats and Republicans, both in the Congress, have not challenged presidents and have let them get away with running the military without that congressional approval. We learned a lesson in Vietnam we seem to have forgotten. The decisions have to be made by the United States Congress in the name of the people."
2019-06-26,Gabbard,"Is that what you will tell the parents of those two soldiers who were just killed in Afghanistan? ìWell we just have to be engaged.î As a soldier, I will tell you that answer is unacceptable. We have to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. We are in a place in Afghanistan where we have lost so many lives. Weíve spent so much money, money thatís coming out of every one of our pockets, money that should be going into communities here at home, meeting the needs of the people here at home. We are no better off in Afghanistan today than we were when this war began. This is why itís so important to have a president, commander in chief, who knows the cost of war and whoís ready to do the job on day one. I am ready to do that job when I walk into the Oval Office."
2019-06-26,Gabbard,"he Taliban was there long before we came in, theyíll be there long before we leave."
2019-06-26,Gabbard,"We cannot keep U.S. troops deployed to Afghanistan thinking that weíre going to somehow squash this Taliban that has been there, that every other country thatís tried and failed."
2019-06-26,Gabbard,he Taliban didnít attack us on 9/11. Al Qaeda did.
2019-06-26,Gabbard,Al Qaeda attacked us on 9/11.
2019-06-26,Gabbard,"hatís why I, and so many other people, joined the military, to go after Al Qaeda, not the Taliban."
2019-06-26,Gabbard,You know whoís protecting Al Qaeda right now? Saudi Arabia.
2019-06-26,Delaney,Can you repeat the question?
2019-06-26,Delaney,"Well the biggest geopolitical challenge is China, but the biggest geopolitical threat remains nuclear weapons."
2019-06-26,Delaney,"You know, those are different questions."
2019-06-26,Inslee,The biggest threat to security of the United States is Donald Trump. Thereís no question.
2019-06-26,Gabbard,he greatest-
2019-06-26,Gabbard,he greatest threat that we face is the fact that we are at a greater risk of nuclear war today than ever before in history.
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"Two threats. Economic threat, China. But our major threat right now is whatís going on in the mid-east with Iran, if we donít get-"
2019-06-26,Warren,Climate change.
2019-06-26,Booker,Nuclear proliferation and climate change.
2019-06-26,Castro,hina and climate change.
2019-06-26,de Blasio,Russia because theyíre trying to undermine our democracy and theyíve been doing a pretty damn good job of it and we need to stop them.
2019-06-26,Delaney,I guess thereís always a first.
2019-06-26,Delaney,I donít think anyoneís above the law. I donít think anyone is above the law including a president. I support Speaker Pelosiís decisions that she is making in the House of Representatives right now as speaker. I think she knows more about the decision as to whether to impeach the president than any of the 2020 candidates combined.
2019-06-26,Delaney,"I do think no oneís above the law and this president, who is lawless, should not be above the law. But I will tell you, Rachel, the one thing when youíre out doing as much campaigning as I have done, 400 events, all 99 counties in Iowa, this is not the number one issue the American people ask us about. Itís not. They want to know what weíre going to do for healthcare, how we are going to lower pharmaceutical prices, how we are going to build infrastructure, what weíre going to do to create jobs in their communities. You know last year in our country 80% of the money for startup businesses went to 50 counties in this country. Thereís over 3,000 counties in this country. Thatís what they care about. They care about whatís going on in the public schools. They care about whatís going on with jobs in their communities, with their pay, with their healthcare, with infrastructure. These are the issues, these kind of kitchen table pocketbook issues are actually what most Americans care about. They never ask about the Mueller report."
2019-06-26,Delaney,They never ask aboutÖ They want to know how weíre going to solve these problems.
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"I wouldnít agree with what the congressman is saying, but if we let the Republicans run our election and if we do not do something about Russian interference in the election and we let Mitch McConnell stop all the backup paper ballots, then weíre not going to get what we want to do-"
2019-06-26,Delaney,Closing now?
2019-06-26,Delaney,"Together we are on a mission. Weíre on a mission to find the America thatís been lost; lost through in-fighting, lost through inaction. Weíre so much better than this. Weíre a country that used to do things. We saved the world. We created the American dream for millions of people like myself, the grandson of immigrants, the son of a union electrician, who went on to become a successful business leader, and create thousands of jobs."
2019-06-26,Delaney,"But we did these things with real solutions, not with impossible promises. And those are the roots that we have to get back to. Iím running for president to solve these problems, to build infrastructure, to fix our broken healthcare system, to invest in communities that have been left behind, to improve public education."
2019-06-26,Delaney,I just donít want to be your president to be your president.
2019-06-26,Delaney,I want to be your president to do the job.
2019-06-26,Delaney,This is not about me. This is about getting America working again.
2019-06-26,de Blasio,"It matters. It matters in this fight for the heart and soul of our party, that we nominate a candidate who has seen the face of poverty and didnít just talk about it, but gave people 15 dollar minimum wage. It matters that we nominate a candidate who saw the destruction wrought by a broken healthcare system, and gave people universal healthcare. It matters that we choose someone who saw the wasted potential of our children denied Pre-K, and gave it to every single one of them for free."
2019-06-26,de Blasio,"These things really matter. And these are the things that Iíve done in New York. And I want to do the same for this whole country, because putting working people first, it matters. We need to be that party again. Letís work together. With your help, we can put working people first again, in America."
2019-06-26,Gabbard,"Our nation was founded on the principles of service above self, people who fled kings, who literally prospered on the backs and the sacrifices of people. Coming here to this country instead putting in place a government that is of, by, and for the people. But thatís not what we have. Instead, we have a government that is of, by, and for the rich and powerful. This must end."
2019-06-26,Gabbard,"As president, our White House, our White House will be a beacon of light, providing hope and opportunity, ushering in a new century, where every single person will be able to get the healthcare they need; where we will have clean air to breathe, and clean water to drink; where we will have good paying jobs, and a new green economy. Join me in ushering this new century with peace, prosperity, opportunity, and justice for all."
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"Three things to know about me. First, I listen to people, and thatís how I get things done. That is my focus. I have a track record of passing over a hundred bills where Iím the lead democrat, and that is because I listened and I acted, and I think thatís important in a president. Everything else just melts away."
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"Secondly, Iím someone that can win, and beat Donald Trump. I have won every place, every race, and every time. I have won in the reddest of districts, ones that Donald Trump won by over 20 points. I can win in states like Wisconsin and Iowa, and in Michigan."
2019-06-26,Klobuchar,"nd finally, yeah, I am not the establishment party candidate. Iíve got respect, but Iím not that person. I am the one that doesnít have a political machine, that doesnít come from money. And I donít make all the promises that everyone up here makes. But I can promise you this. I am going to govern with integrity, Iím going to have your back, and Iím going to govern for you."
2019-06-26,Booker,"Gracias. Fifty years ago, this month, my family moved into the town I grew up in, because after being denied a house because of the color of their skin, it was activists, mostly white activists that stood up and fought for them. Thatís the best of who we are as America, and why when I got out of law school, I moved into the inner city of Newark, to fight as a tenant lawyer for other peopleís rights. Iíve taken on bullies, and beat them. Iíve taken on tought fights, and weíve won. And we win those fights not by showing the worst of who we are, but rising to whoís best."
2019-06-26,Booker,"Donald Trump wants us to fight him on his turf, and his terms. We will beat him. I will beat him by calling this country to a sense of common purpose again. This is a referendum on him and getting rid of him, but itís also a referendum on us, who we are, and who we must be to each other. Itís time we win this election. And the way Iíll govern is by showing the best of who we are, because thatís what this country needs and deserves."
2019-06-26,Warren,"Thank you. Itís a great honor to be here. Never in a million years did I think I would stand on a stage like this. I was born and raised in Oklahoma. I have three older brothers. They all joined the military. I had a dream growing up, and my dream was to be a public school teacher. By the time I graduated from high school, my family, my family didnít have the money for a college application, much less a chance for me to go to college."
2019-06-26,Warren,"But I got my chance. It was a 50 dollar a semester commuter college, that was a little slice of government that created some opportunity for a girl. And It opened my life. I am in this fight, because I believe that we can make our government. We can make our economy. We can make our country work, not just for those at the top. We can make it work for everyone, and I promise you this; I will fight for you, as hard as I fight for my own family."
